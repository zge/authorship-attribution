Our final discussion in basic text
processing is segmenting out sentences
from running text. So how are we going to
segment out sentences? Things that end in
exclamation points or question marks,
that's really great because those are
relatively unambiguous clues that we've
gotten to the end of a sentence. Periods,
unfortunately, are quite ambiguous. If you
think about it, a period can be a sentence
boundary. But, periods are also used for
abbreviations like, inc. Or Dr., they're
used for numbers like, point 02, or four
point three. So, we can't assume that a
period is the end of a sentence. So what
we need to do, to solve the period problem
is build ourselves a classifier. We're
going to build ourselves a binary
classifier. Looks at a period. And simply
makes that binary yes no decision; am I at
the end of a sentence, am I not at the end
of a sentence. And to make this
classifier, we could use handwritten
rules, we could use regular expressions,
we could build machine learning
classifiers. The simplest kind of
classifier for this is a decision tree. So
here's a simple decision tree for
deciding. Whether a word is at the end of
a sentence or not. So a decision tree is a
simple if then procedure that asks a
question and branches based on the answer
to the question. So we say, am I in a
piece of text that has a lot of blank
lines after me. Well if so, then I'm
probably at an end of sentence. What if
there's no blank lines after me? Well, is
my final punctuation a question mark or an
exclamation point? If so, well then I'm
still probably end of sentence. Well if
not that is my final punctuation a period.
If it's not, well I'm, I'm not an end of
sentence. But if I am a period, well then
it depends. If I'm on some long list of
abbreviations like the word ETC then I'm
probably not an end of sentence I'm just a
period marking an abbreviation like doctor
or ETC. But if I'm not an abbreviation
then I'm end of sentence. So here's a
decision tree. And you could imagine
arbitrarily sophisticated decision tree
features that we could use. So one thing
we could use is the case or, it's called
the word shape of the word with a period.
Am I an uppercase word? Am I a lowercase
word? Am I all caps? So uppercase meaning
the first letter is uppercase, lower
meaning it's lowercase, cap meaning it's
all caps. Am I a number? Any of these kind
of word shape features can give us
information. An all caps word is very
likely to be a. And a abbreviation. We can
look at the word, with the abbrevi, with
the Period, we can look at the word after
the period, if, the next word starts with
a capital letter then I'm likely to be the
beginning, a period that ends a sentence
because the next word starts with a
capital letter. And we can look at lots of
numeric features. So we can look at, am I
a long word? Or a short word? So
abbreviations tend to be relatively short,
acronyms tend to be very short. And I can
use very sophisticated features, so I can
say lets look at the, the, word I'm
looking at right now. Take this word and
ask. In a corpus that I already know where
the sentence boundaries are, how often is
this word occur with a period at the end
of a sentence? Is this the kind of word
that ends a sentence? Is this the kind of
word, for example, that tends to start a
sentence? Is this the word that. This
phrase for example the word, the, after a
period they are likely to be a capital
THE, after a period very likely to start a
sentence with space in between. So this
will have a high probability of being a
start of a sentence and we can use these
kind of features depending on condition of
each of the words again to help us in
deciding what is or isn't a end of
sentence period. Now a decision tree is
just an if, then and else statement. So,
the, the that, that's just a. The
definition of what a decision tree is. The
interesting research is choosing the
features. So we've seen a number of
features you might pick for this
particular task. In general, the structure
of a decision tree is not, is often too
hard to build by hand. In general, hand
building of decision trees is possible
only for very simple features or simple
domains. You might build a simple decision
tree with six or seven rules like this for
some simple tasks. But it's very hard to
do for numeric features because. You have
to pick the thresh hold for each of the
numeric feature. I am picking up
probability as one of my features. I've
gotta have a question in the decision
tree, is this probability greater than
some thresh hold data or not and I've got
to set all those datas and so generally we
use machine learning that learns the
structure of the tree and learns things
like the thresh hold for each of the
questions that we're asking. Nonetheless
the questions in a decision tree, we can
think of them as the kind of features that
could be exploited by any other
classifier, whether it's linguistic
regression or SVMs or neural nets, some of
the classifiers we'll talk about later. So
this, this intuition that we can build a
classifier, we can derive features that
are good predictors of whether a period is
acting as an end of sentence or not, and
then we can put these features into any
kind of classifier, hold for, whatever
classifier we're going to be using.

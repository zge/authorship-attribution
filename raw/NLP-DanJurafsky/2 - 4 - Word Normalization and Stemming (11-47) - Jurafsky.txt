Once we've segmented out words, or
tokenized them, we need to normalize them,
and stem them. So normalizing means
different things. For information
retrieval, for example, we require that
the index text and the query terms have to
have the same form. So we wanna match U.,
S., A., to USA. If somebody asks a
question or a query with, with one of
them. And the answer has the other, we
want them to match. So it's like
implicitly defining some kind of
equivalent class of terms. We might do
this by always deleting periods, for
example, it might take to have a rule that
takes U., S., A. To USA. An alternative is
some kind of asymmetric expansion. So, for
example, let's say it's, we're doing
information retrieval. If I enter the term
window, I might wanna search for window or
windows or any, any, any morphological
variant of the word window. But, if I
enter capital W windows, I might only
wanna search for capital W windows, 'cause
the person's presumably looking for the
product and not the part of your house. I
mean this is a potentially more powerful
algorithm but less efficient and much more
complicated. So in general, we use
symmetric and relatively simple
expansions. So for example, in information
retrieval, we generally remove, reduce all
letters to lowercase since users tend to
use lowercase and with some small
exceptions. So for example, if we see
uppercase in the middle of a sentence like
General Motors, we might want to keep the
case. And this matters for distinguishing
the verb Fed from the Federal
Reserve Bank with a capital F, are more a
group like SAIL, the Stanford Artificial
Intelligence Lab from the verb sail. And
it turns out that for sentiment analysis
or machine translation or information
extraction. Case is in fact very helpful.
So it was a big difference between U S and
to us. We also often want to do
lemmatization, so we're reducing our
inflections or variant forms to their base
form. So words like am and are and is will
get lemmatized into be car cars, car,
car's, and so on, get lemmatized to car. So
a phrase like the boy's cars are different
colors should get lemmatized to the boy car
be different color. So in general the task
of limatization is finding the correct
dictionary head word form for a word form
that you are given and of course this is
very important for all sorts of
applications particularly machine
translations. Where for example if you
have a Spanish verb like "quiero" (I want)
or "quieres" (you want). You it's very
important to know if this is the same
lemma as "querer", the verb to
want. So, this general topic of looking at
parts of words leads us to morphology. And
morphology is the study of morpheme. And a
morpheme is the smallest unit that makes
up a word. We usually distinguish two
kinds of morphemes. Stems that's the core
meaning bearing units in a word. And affixes,
affix is the bits and pieces that
adhere to the stem, often they have
grammatical functions. So on this, I-,
particular slide in fact, stem is a stem,
and -s is an affix. The word affix, just
to confuse us, is a stem, and the -es is
the affix, so there's an affix. There's an
-s, and there's an -s, and meaning-"ful",
there's another affix, and so on. So
stemming is the task of taking off these
affixes to reduce terms to their stem. And
it's particularly, historically derived
from information retrieval, although it's
used in all sorts of applications. We use
the word 'stemming' when we specifically
mean a kind of a crude chopping off of, of
affixes, and this is of course a
language-dependent kind of process, so the
English word, automate, automates,
automatic, automation, we'd like them all
to refer to the same stem, automat. So
stemming is like a, simplified version of
lemmatization where we pick a prefix of the
word, use that to represent the word, and
we, we, chop off all suffixes, that are
relevant, leading to that stem. So here's
an example, little text For example,
compressed and compression are both
accepted as equivalent to compress, that's
the text. And if we stemmed that text,
here's the resulting output so you can see
that, that we've lost the E on example,
and compressed and compressing have both
turned into compress and here we used ar.
We could have used "be" as our representation
of  "ar", but this particular example we used
"ar" and so on. The, the simplest algorithm,
the most commonly used one for simple
stemming of English is the Porter
algorithm. And the Porter's algorithm is a
series of, an iterated series of simple
rules, simple, replace rules. So, for
example, one set of rules, rule step 1A,
takes strings like. S-s-e-s and replaces
them with S-S. So in a word like caresses,
it chops off the E-S at the caresses, or a
rule that takes I-E-S to I. Chops off the,
IES in ponies, and levy pony. We're gonna
use pony with an I, as the representation
in Porter stemming of pony. And the rules
operate in order, so that, at this point,
if there's any ss's left they stay as an
S. But any other ss's get deleted at this
point. So the s of cats is deleted, while
the ss of caress is kept. Similarly
in step 1B, we might, we remove all of the
ings and the eds, so we want to cross off
the ing of walk and the ed of plaster, but
we specify the rule very carefully, that in the Porter's stemmer only words with a vowel get
their ings removed, and that's because a
world like sing, only words where there's
a vow-, an additional vowel before the
ing. So a world like sing, which has no
extra vowels, sing only has one vowel, the
vowel in ing, stays as sing. But walk-ing,
which has. A vowel, and in addition a
vowel before the -ing is allowed to delete
the suffix. So, if a word has a vowel
followed by -ing, the -ing is deleted. And
there's lots of other such rules. So,
-ational turns into -ate. So, we can cross
off all of relational and the -tion and
end up with relate. And -izer to -ize and
so we cross out the r and so on. And the
roads get even more complicated so as you
get to very long stems your going to
remove the -al from revival and the -able and
so on. [sound] Let's look again at this
rule that strips aim and practice using
the Unix tools that we saw in the last
section. To look at morphology in a
corpus. So remember, why are we stripping
the -ing's only if there's a vowel
preceding the -ing? Here is the rule. And
remember we said that in a word like
walking, we have a vowel before the -ing
and so it's okay to remove the -ing. In a
word like sing, there is no vowel before,
there's no letters at all before that s.
There's no previous vowels and so sing,
the rule doesn't apply. [sound] And lets
do a little. Search four words ending in
ing, in Shakespeare. So were gonna first
take all of Shakespeare and turn all the
non-alphabetic characters. [sound] Oops.
[sound] Turn [inaudible] characters into
new lines, so we're gonna get one word per
line, then we're gonna. Translate all of
the upper case to lower case. So we're
dealing with combining all the upper case
and lower case words. And now let's grep
out, grep. Is a program for, for, finding
any line that contains a regular
expression in a file. Very useful Unix
program. So we're gonna look for the
regular expression, ING$. And, so we'll
find all. Words ending in I-n-g and let's
sort them. And then we'll just take one
copy of each and count them and then sort
them by the counts. And let's see what
words we find of ending in I-n-g in
Shakespeare. And what we see is lots of
these words are not words that in fact we
would like to, to, To remove the ing from
so, we have words like king and nothing
and thing and ring and something and sing
and anything and spring. So this, this is
a lot of words, a lot of very frequent
words, in fact that it would be a bad idea
to remove the ing. If we remove the ing
from king we'd get k and so on, remove the
ing from spring and we get SP. So let's
modify our rule That we did, instead of
saying grepping for all words ending in
ing, let's just go back and change that to
grep for all words with a vowel, we'll
just make it be a e I o u, simulate our
vowels with just the vowel letters and we
need some way to say there's a vowel and
that anything can happen in between,
followed by the ing. Well, how do we say
anything? Dot means any character, star
meaning zero more of those, and now let's
look at, at what words we get back from
that pattern. And now, since we specified
that the word has to start with a vowel,
we've done a much better job of finding
two syllable words where the ing, in fact,
is supposed to be stripped off. So there
are still some problematic words, like
nothing and something. We don't wanna
noth-, and someth-, and anything. But
otherwise. Maybe not cunning but otherwise
we've done a pretty good job of making the
rule a little bit better. And so there's a
little explanation of, how the Porter
stemmer works and then how we can actually
use our Unix tools to do a little corpus
linguistics to, to help write rules of
this kind. So that's a simple example of
morphology. It turns out that in some
languages much more complex morphology is
necessary, and Turkish is the famous
example of this. So here's a word in
Turkish which I am, I won't be able to
pronounce for you which means behaving as
if you were among those whom we could not
civilized. So I see it's the kind of thing
your mother says to you when, when you've
been particularly naughty. And in Turkish
this is one word. So it's a very long word
with a lot of, Stems. We have the, the,
the civilized stem, and an affix meaning
become, and, and affix meaning cause,
and an affix meaning not able, and so on.
So in languages like Turkish, and as we
saw earlier, for, the very long nouns in,
German, we're gonna have to do, richer and
more complex morpheme segmentation. So as
we've seen word tokenization and now we've
seen that words will have to normalized
and stems to map them to a normal form.

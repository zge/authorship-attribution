Let's begin our discussion of minimum edit
distance by defining minimum edit
distance. Minimum at a distance is a way
of solving the problem of string
similarity, how similar are two strings.
So let's pick a particular example. Spell
correction, the user typed graffe, what do
they really mean? And one way of
operationalizing this question is asking
which of the following words is closer to
the letters that they typed. Graph, graft,
grail, or giraffe. The problem of string
similarity comes up also in computational
biology, where we have sequences of
nucleotides. A, C, G, T [inaudible] we're
trying to align. And a good alignment
should be able to tell us that two
particular sequences, perhaps from two
samples line up in a certain way with some
amount of error. And this idea of string
similarity or sequence similarity comes up
from machine translation, from information
extraction, from speech recognition, comes
up everywhere. So let's define edit
distance. The minimum edit distance
between two strings is the minimum number
of editing operations, insertion,
deletion, and substitution, that are
needed to transform one into the other.
And we generally use these three, editing
operations, insertion, deletion, and
substitution, You can imagine more
complicated transpositions and, and long
distance movements, but we tend to avoid
those. So for example we have the string
intention and the string execution. Here's
an alignment showing that many of the
letters line up. And with some
substitutions and then there are some gaps
where a gap here lines up with a letter C
in execution and a gap in execution lines
up with a letter I in intention and so on.
So we can think about this alignment as
having a set of operations that generated
the alignment. So here the to turn
intention into execution we have to
delete (D for delete) an I, we substitute
an N for an E. Substitute a T for an X.
Insert a C. Substitute an N for U. And the
rest of the letters, the E, the T, I, O, N
are all the same. So the edit distance if
each operation is one, is five. There's
five. We had to do five things to turn
intention into execution. If substitutions
cost two, this is called Levenshtein
distance. In Levenshtein distance,
insertions and deletions cost one, but
substitutions cost two, and now the
distance between these two strings is now
eight. In computational biology we've seen
sequences of bases, and our job is to
figure out that this A aligns to this A
and this G to this G and, and, maybe this
T A T and C A C and so on. So, this C to
here so we have some, so we can see that
there's some kind of insertion there and
we can represent, again, that alignment
between characters by showing this align
string of symbols. So the task is, given
two sequences align each letter to a
letter in a gap, that's our task in
biology. Edit distance comes up all over
the place. In machine translation, for
example, we'd like to measure how well a
machine translation system does. So, let's
suppose our machine translation system
Represented some sentence, maybe
translated from Chinese. As the spokesman
said, the senior advisor was shot dead.
And some human, expert translator said it
should have been spokesman confirms senior
government advisor was shot. So we can
measure the difference between these two
by saying how many words changed. Confirms
was, was substituted with said. Words that
were inserted. And the and words and dead.
And words that were deleted government. So
it, we have measuring how good our machine
translation is by comparing it to humans.
Similarly, in tasks like the entity
extraction, you know, if IBM Inc. and IBM
are the same entity, or if Stanford
University president John Hennessy is the
same entity as Stanford president John
Hennessy, then we can do that by using at
a distance to notice that these are very
similar, with one word different, and
here, one word different. And so, by
measuring the number of words different,
we can, improve our accuracy at the
invented extraction, and, and other kinds
of tasks. Alright. So how are we going to
find this minimum at a distance? Our
intuition for this algorithm is to search
for a path. By path we mean a sequence of
edits from the start string to the final
string. So we'll start with an initial
state, so that will be the word we're
transforming. We'll have a set of
operators: insertion, deletion,
substitution, and we'll have a goal state,
that's the word we're trying to get to.
And, finally, we'll have a cost for the
path of getting there, and that' the thing
we're trying to minimize. So that's the
number of x. That's our path cost. So, for
example from intention here's a piece of
the path. From intention we could delete a
letter and end up with ntention. We could
insert a letter and end up with e
eintention or we could substitute a letter
and end up with entention. So that's,
these are pieces along a path that would
go from intention. All the way off the
screen here into all the possible ways you
can transform intention into something.
So, this space of all possible sequences
is enormous. So we can't afford to
navigate naively in this, in this
sequence. And the intuition of solving
this problem of lots of possible sequences
is some of these paths wind up at the same
state. So, we don't have to keep track of
every way of transforming one string into
another if the second pieces of the set
are identical. All we have to keep. Is the
shortest path to every revisited state. So
let's look at an example of how this
works, we are gonna to define minimum edit
distance formally as, for two strings. You
have string X of length N and string Y of
length M. We'll define a distance matrix,
D(i, j). And that will be the
edit distance between the first i
characters, one through i, of X and the
first j characters, one through j, of
string Y. So that's the, that's what's in
that's what's defined by D(i, j). And so,
the distance between the entire two
strings is gonna be D(N, M) because
the strings are of length N and M. So that's
our definition of minimum added distance.

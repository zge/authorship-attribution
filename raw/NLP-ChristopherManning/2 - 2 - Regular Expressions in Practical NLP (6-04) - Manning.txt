In recent [inaudible] these days there's
always a lot of talk of probabilistic
models and machine mining. But if you
actually look at large systems under the
hood what you'll almost always find is
that they also make quite a bit of use of
regular expressions in various places. And
for many tasks it turns out that regular
expressions are just a very practical and
capable way of specifying various kinds of
natural language patterns. I'm gonna show
you one example of this now by showing how
we use regular expressions for the English
tokenizer inside. Stanford and OP tools
such as the passiron part of speech tagger
or for the coranal P suite overall. Okay
here we are with the code for the Stanford
English [inaudible]. So what it is, is
it's a large determinate stick. Regular
expression. So what is written in is with
a tool called J-Flex. So J-Flex belongs to
a family of what are commonly called in
computer science, lexors, which is just
another word for tokenizers, which take a
sequence of characters and cut pieces one
token at a time off the front of it. So
that was the original lexor part of the
unix, and then flex. And then this is
J-Flex, which is a java compatable
version. Let's scroll down to where some
of the regular expressions are used to
define character classes. Often what you
find is that many of the regular
expressions aren't actually very
complicated, that they're really nothing
more than lists that are being put into
regular expressions by putting verticle
bars in between for alternation. And so,
for example, we see that in several places
here. So here we have one for abbreviated
months and here we have one for
abbreviated days of the week, and that
continues on for some of these other ones,
like American states and various other
kinds of person, name, title, acronym.
[inaudible] Down here. But lets go on a
little bit further to one that's a bit
more interesting than that. Okay. So,
here's one of phone numbers. This is the
kind of ill-documented regular expression
that's a little bit hard to actually get
your head around, but are much used in
practice. So, at the very top level of
this regular expression, things are
divided up by this alternation right here,
and. The right hand side of the
ordination, there's a [inaudible], where
the separator is being used as dots. And
so that one's separated out as consistent
use of dots, cuz otherwise it's easy for
the regular expression to go wrong and
also recognize various kinds of
[inaudible] numbers and other patterns.
And so that part of it is actually the
easier part. So we can have at the
beginning, optionally, the use of plus
signs, which are used in Europe and most
of the rest of the world as an
International prefix by county codes. And
then we. Have the country code here which
is just numbers of the range two to four.
And then all of that is optional. And then
after that. We've got a first set of
numbers, which can be the area code, the
dot then the second set of numbers, which
I guess historically is the exchange and
then finally the third set of numbers and
so these sets of numbers are then being
given a length. So this has to be between
three and four numbers, this has to be
three and five numbers and the area code
has to be two and four numbers and so
those ranges are chosen so that they'll
work with the phone numbers of a bunch of
the countries around the world. But if you
know well your international phone. You'll
realize there actually are some cases that
won't still be recognized by those. So
what then if we go. To the left-hand side
of the regular expression. It's
effectively doing the same thing but just
more complex. So that the first part of it
is again going to recognize. Things like
optional country codes, so you can see the
same piece over here. [sound].
[inaudible]. Country code. But it's
allowing in some other possibilities. So
here we've escaped [inaudible] so you can
actually sort of have some numbers that
are put inside of parentheses and further
on we have got this character class. We're
allowing a variety of separators apart
from period. So we can have dash which
again needs to be escaped. There can just
be a space or there can be a non breaking
space [inaudible] for a non braking space.
So overall this. Will allow it to
recognize a bunch of formats for phone
numbers. So it'll recognize almost all
American phone numbers, and generally does
pretty well with things like UK and
Australian phone numbers. If you want an
example of where it doesn't work, the
normal phone number format in France is
you just have pairs of digits with spaces
in between them. And that's not included
here. And the difficulty. Isn't sort of
writing a regular expression that matches
that. It's in this context of [inaudible].
Make their expression match her of
managing to write one, which wanted to alo
wrongly match various other things, such
as numbers that just appearing as a
sequence of numbers for some other reason.
Well I hope that's given you some idea of
the use of regular expressions and NLP
systems. If you polk around another NLP
system, I'm sure you'll find lots of other
examples. Commonly when people want to
match particular patterns, whether they be
patterns at the level of words or patterns
at the level of parts of speech, they can
just be very convenient and practical
methods to solve many practical tasks.

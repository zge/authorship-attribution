In this and the next
few videos, I want to
start to talk about classification problems,
where the variable y that
you want to predict is discreet
valued. We'll develop an
algorithm called logistic regression,
which is one of the
most popular and most widely used learning algorithms today.
Here are some examples of classification problems.
Earlier, we talked about emails,
spam classification as an
example of a classification problem.
Another example would be classifying online transactions.
So, if you have a website
that sells stuff and if you
want to know if a physical
transaction is fraudulent or
not, whether someone has, you
know, is using a stolen credit card
or has stolen the user's password.
That's another classification problem, and
earlier we also talked about
the example of classifying tumors
as a cancerous malignant or as benign tumors.
In all of these problems,
the variable that we're trying
to predict is a variable
Y that we can think
of as taking on two values,
either zero or one, either
a spam or not spam, fraudulent
or not fraudulent, malignant or benign.
Another name for the class
that we denote with 0 is
the negative class, and another
name for the class that we
denote with 1 is the positive class.
So 0 may denote the
benign tumor and 1
positive class may denote a malignant tumor.
The assignment of the 2
classes, you know, spam,
no spam, and so on -
the assignment of the 2
classes to positive and negative,
to 0 and 1 is somewhat
arbitrary and it doesn't really matter.
But often there is this
intuition that the negative
class is conveying the
absence of something, like the absence
of a malignant tumor, whereas one,
the positive class, is conveying
the presence of something that we may be looking for.
But the definition of which
is negative and which is positive
is somewhat arbitrary and it doesn't matter that much.
For now, we're going to start
with classification problems with just
two classes; zero and one.
Later on, we'll talk about multi-class
problems as well, whether variable
Y may take on say,
for value zero, one, two and three.
This is called a multi-class classification problem,
but for the next few
videos, let's start with the
two class or the binary classification problem.
and we'll worry about the multi-class setting later.
So, how do we develop a classification algorithm?
Here's an example of a
training set for a classification
task for classifying a tumor
as malignant or benign and
notice that malignancy takes on
only two values zero or
no or one or one or yes.
So, one thing we could
do given this training set
is to apply the algorithm
that we already know, linear regression to this data set
and just try to fit the straight line to the data.
So, if you take this training
set and fill a straight
line to it, maybe you get
hypothesis that looks like that.
Alright, so that's my hypothesis, h of
x equals theta transpose
x.
If you want
to make predictions, one thing
you could try doing is then
threshold the classifier outputs at 0.5.
That is at the vertical access value 0.5.
And if the hypothesis outputs
a value that's greater than
equal to 0.5 you predict y equals one.
If it's less than 0.5, you predict y equals zero.
Let's see what happens when we do that.
So, let's take 0.5, and
so, you know, that's where the threshold is.
And thus, using linear regression this way.
Everything to the right
of this point, we will end
up predicting as the positive
class because of the output
values are greater than 0.5
on the vertical axis and
everything to the left
of that point we will end
up predicting as a negative value.
In this particular example, it
looks like linear regression is actually
doing something reasonable even though
this is a classification task we're
interested in.
But now let's try changing problem a bit.
Let me extend out the horizontal
axis of orbit and let's
say we got one more training
example way out there on the right.
Notice that that additional training
example, this one out
here, it doesn't actually change anything, right?
Looking at the training set, it
is pretty clear what a good hypothesis is.
Well, everything to the right of
somewhere around here to the
right of this we should predict
as positive, and everything to
the left we should probably predict
as negative because from this
training set it looks like
all the tumors larger than, you
know, a certain value around here
are malignant, and all the
tumors smaller than that are
not malignant, at least for this training set.
But once we've added
that extra example out here,
if you now run linear regression,
you instead get a straight line fit to the data.
That might maybe look like this, and
if you now threshold this hypothesis
at 0.5, you end up with
a threshold that's around here
so that everything to the right
of this point you predict as
positive, and everything to the left of that point you predict as negative.
And this seems a pretty
bad thing for linear regression to have done, right?
Because, you know, these are
our positive examples, these are our negative examples.
It's pretty clear, we should
really be separating the two classes
somewhere around there, but somehow
by adding one example way
out here to the right, this
example really isn't giving us any new information.
I mean, it should be no
surprise to the learning out of
that the example way out here turns out to be malignant.
But somehow adding that example
out there caused linear regression
to change in straight line fit
to the data from this
magenta line out here
to this blue line over here,
and caused it to give us a worse hypothesis.
So, applying linear regression
to a classification problem usually
isn't, often isn't a great idea.
In the first instance, in the
first example before I added
this extra training example,
previously linear regression was
just getting lucky and it
got us a hypothesis that, you
know, worked well for that particular
example, but usually apply
linear regression to a data set,
you know, you might get lucky but
often it isn't a good
idea, so I wouldn't use
linear regression for classification problems.
Here is one other funny thing
about what would happen if
we were to use linear regression for a classification problem.
For classification, we know that
Y is either zero or one,
but if you are using
linear regression, well the hypothesis
can output values much larger
than one or less than
zero, even if all
of good the training examples have labels
Y equals zero or one,
and it seems kind of strange
that even though we
know that the label should
be zero one, it seems
kind of strange if the
algorithm can offer values much
larger than one or much smaller than zero.
So what we'll do in the
next few videos is develop
an algorithm called logistic regression
which has the property that the
output, the predictions of logistic
regression are always between zero
and one, and doesn't become
bigger than one or become less
than zero and by
the way, logistic regression is
and we will use it as
a classification algorithm in some,
maybe sometimes confusing that
the term regression appears in
his name, even though logistic regression
is actually a classification algorithm.
But that's just the name it
was given for historical reasons so don't be confused by that.
Logistic Regression is actually a
classification algorithm that we
apply to settings where the
label Y is discreet valued. The 1001.
So hopefully you now
know why if you
have a causation problem using
linear regression isn't a good idea .
In the next video we'll
start working out the details
of the logistic regression algorithm.

For logistic regression, we previously
talked about two types of optimization algorithms.
We talked about how to use
gradient descent to optimize as cost function J of theta.
And we also talked about
advanced optimization methods.
Ones that require that you
provide a way to compute
your cost function J of
theta and that you provide a way to compute the derivatives.
In this video, we'll show how
you can adapt both of
those techniques, both gradient descent and
the more advanced optimization techniques
in order to have them
work for regularized logistic regression.
So, here's the idea.
We saw earlier that Logistic
Regression can also be prone
to overfitting if you fit
it with a very, sort of,
high order polynomial features like this.
Where G is the
sigmoid function and in
particular you end up with
a hypothesis, you know,
whose decision bound to be
just sort of an overly complex
and extremely contortive function that
really isn't such a great
hypothesis for this training
set, and more generally if you have
logistic regression with a lot of features.
Not necessarily polynomial ones, but
just with a lot of
features you can end up with overfitting.
This was our cost function for logistic regression.
And if we want to modify
it to use regularization, all we
need to do is add to
it the following term
plus londer over 2M, sum
from J equals 1, and
as usual sum from J equals 1.
Rather than the sum from J
equals 0, of theta J squared.
And this has to
effect therefore, of penalizing
the parameters theta 1 theta
2 and so on up to theta N from being too large.
And if you do this,
then it will the have the
effect that even though you're fitting
a very high order polynomial with a lot of parameters.
So long as you apply regularization
and keep the parameters small
you're more likely to get a decision boundary.
You know, that maybe looks more like this.
It looks more reasonable for separating
the positive and the negative examples.
So, when using regularization
even when you have a lot
of features, the regularization can
help take care of the overfitting problem.
How do we actually implement this?
Well, for the original gradient descent
algorithm, this was the update we had.
We will repeatedly perform the following
update to theta J. This
slide looks a lot like the previous one for linear regression.
But what I'm going to do is
write the update for theta 0 separately.
So, the first line is
for update for theta 0 and
a second line is now
my update for theta 1
up to theta N.
Because I'm going to treat theta 0 separately.
And in order to
modify this algorithm, to use
a regularized cos function,
all I need to do is
pretty similar to what we
did for linear regression is
actually to just modify this
second update rule as follows.
And, once again, this, you know,
cosmetically looks identical what
we had for linear regression.
But of course is not the
same algorithm as we had,
because now the hypothesis
is defined using this.
So this is not the same algorithm
as regularized linear regression.
Because the hypothesis is different.
Even though this update that I wrote down.
It actually looks cosmetically the
same as what we had earlier.
We're working out gradient descent for regularized linear regression.
And of course, just to wrap
up this discussion, this term
here in the square
brackets, so this term
here, this term is,
of course, the new partial
derivative for respect of
theta J of the new cost function J of theta.
Where J of theta here is
the cost function we defined on
a previous slide that does use regularization.
So, that's gradient descent for regularized linear regression.
Let's talk about how to
get regularized linear regression
to work using the more
advanced optimization methods.
And just to remind you for
those methods what we needed
to do was to define the
function that's called the cost
function, that takes us
input the parameter vector theta and
once again in the equations
we've been writing here we used 0 index vectors.
So we had theta 0 up
to theta N. But
because Octave indexes the vectors starting from 1.
Theta 0 is written
in Octave as theta 1.
Theta 1 is written in
Octave as theta 2, and
so on down to theta
N plus 1.
And what we needed to
do was provide a function.
Let's provide a function called
cost function that we would
then pass in to what we have, what we saw earlier.
We will use the fminunc
and then
you know at cost function,
and so on, right.
But the F min, u
and c was the F min
unconstrained and this will
work with fminunc
was what will take
the cost function and minimize it for us.
So the two main things that
the cost function needed to
return were first J-val.
And for that, we need
to write code to
compute the cost function J of theta.
Now, when we're using regularized logistic
regression, of course the
cost function j of theta
changes and, in particular,
now a cost function needs to
include this additional regularization term at the end as well.
So, when you compute j of
theta be sure to include that term at the end.
And then, the other thing that
this cost function thing
needs to derive with a gradient.
So gradient one needs
to be set to the
partial derivative of J
of theta with respect to theta
zero, gradient two needs
to be set to that, and so on.
Once again, the index is off by one.
Right, because of the indexing from
one Octave users.
And looking at these terms.
This term over here.
We actually worked this out
on a previous slide is actually equal to this.
It doesn't change.
Because the derivative for theta zero doesn't change.
Compared to the version without regularization.
And the other terms do change.
And in particular the derivative respect to theta one.
We worked this out on the previous slide as well.
Is equal to, you know,
the original term and then minus
londer M times theta 1.
Just so we make sure we pass this correctly.
And we can add parentheses here.
Right, so the summation doesn't extend.
And similarly, you know,
this other term here looks
like this, with this additional
term that we had on
the previous slide, that corresponds to
the gradient from their regularization objective.
So if you implement this
cost function and pass
this into fminunc
or to one of those advanced optimization
techniques, that will minimize
the new regularized cost function J of theta.
And the parameters you get out
will be the ones that correspond to
logistic regression with regularization.
So, now you know
how to implement regularized logistic regression.
When I walk around Silicon Valley,
I live here in Silicon Valley, there are
a lot of engineers that are frankly, making
a ton of money for their
companies using machine learning algorithms.
And I know we've
only been, you know, studying this stuff for a little while.
But if you understand linear
regression, the advanced optimization
algorithms and regularization, by
now, frankly, you probably know
quite a lot more machine learning
than many, certainly now,
but you probably know quite a
lot more machine learning right now
than frankly, many of the
Silicon Valley engineers out there having very successful careers.
You know, making tons of money for the companies.
Or building products using machine learning algorithms.
So, congratulations.
You've actually come a long ways.
And you can actually, you
actually know enough to
apply this stuff and get to work for many problems.
So congratulations for that.
But of course, there's
still a lot more that we
want to teach you, and in
the next set of videos after
this, we'll start to talk
about a very powerful cause of non-linear classifier.
So whereas linear regression, logistic
regression, you know, you can
form polynomial terms, but it
turns out that there are much
more powerful nonlinear quantifiers that
can then sort of polynomial regression.
And in the next set
of videos after this one, I'll start telling you about them.
So that you have even more
powerful learning algorithms than you have
now to apply to different problems.

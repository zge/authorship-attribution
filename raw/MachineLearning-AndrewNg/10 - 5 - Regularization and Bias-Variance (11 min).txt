You've seen how regularization can help
prevent overfitting, but how
does it affect the bias and
variance of a learning algorithm?
In this video, I like to
go deeper into the issue
of bias and variance, and
talk about how it interacts
with, and is effected by,
the regularization of your learning algorithm.
Suppose we fit a linear
regression model with a very
high order polynomial, but to
prevent overfitting, we are
going to use regularization as shown here.
Suppose we're fitting a high
order polynomial like that shown
here, but to prevent
overfitting, we're going to
use regularization, like that shown
here, so we have this regularization
term to try to
keep the values of the parameters small.
And as usual, the regularization sums
from j equals 1 to
m rather than j equals 0
to m.  Let's consider three cases.
The first is the case of
a very large value of the
regularization parameter lambda, such
as if lambda were
equal to 10,000s of huge value.
In this
case, all of these
parameters, theta 1, theta 2,
theta 3 and so on will
be heavily penalized and
so, what ends up with most
of these parameter values being close
to 0 and the hypothesis will be
roughly h or x
just equal or approximately equal
to theta 0, and so we
end up a hypothesis that more
or less looks like that. This is more or
less a flat, constant straight line.
And so this hypothesis has high
bias and a value underfits this data set.
So the horizontal straight
line is just not a very
good model for this data set.
At the other extreme beam is if we have
a very small value of
lambda, such as if lambda
were equal to 0.
In that case, given that we're
fitting a high order polynomial,
this is a
usual overfitting setting.
In that case, given that we're
fitting a high order polynomial,
basically without regularization or with
very minimal regularization, we end
up with our usual high variance, overfitting
setting, because basically if lambda is
equal to zero, we are just
fitting with our regularization so
that overfits the hypothesis
and is only if we have some
intermediate value of lambda that is neither too large nor too small that we end up with parameters theta
that we end up that give us a reasonable
fit to this data.
So how can we automatically
choose a good value
for the regularization parameter lambda?
Just to reiterate, here is our model and here is our learning algorithm subjective.
For the setting where we're using regularization, let me define
j train of theta to be something different
to be the optimization objective
but without the regularization term.
Previously, in earlier video
when we are not using
regularization, I define j train of theta to
be the same as j of theta as the cost function but
when we are using regularization with this extra lambda term
we're going to
define j train my training set error,
to be just my sum of
squared errors on the training
set, or my average squared error
on the training set without taking into account that regularization chart.
And similarly, I'm then
also going to define the
cross-validation set error when the
test set error, as before
to be the average sum of squared errors
on the cross-validation and the test sets.
So just to summarize,
my definitions of J train and
J C V and J
Test are just the
average squared error, or one
half of the average
squared error on my training validation and
test sets without the extra
regularization chart.
So, this is how we can automatically choose the regularization parameter lambda.
What I usually do is may
be have some range of values of lambda I want to try it.
So I might be
considering not using regularization,
or here are a few values I might try.
I might be considering along because
of O1, O2 from O4 and so on.
And you know, I usually step these
up in multiples of
two until some maybe larger value
this in multiples of two you
I actually end up with 10.24;
it's ten exactly, but you
know, this is close enough and
the 35 decimal
places won't affect your result that much.
So, this gives me, maybe
twelve different models, that I'm
trying to select amongst, corresponding to
12 different values of the
regularization parameter lambda and
of course, you can also go
to values less than 0.01
or values larger than 10,
but I've just truncated it here for convenience.
Given each of these 12
models, what we can
do is then the following:
we take this first
model with lambda equals 0,
and minimize my cos
function j of theta and this
would give me some parameter vector theta
and similar to the earlier video,
let me just denote this as
theta superscript 1.
And then I can take my
second model, with lambda
set to 0.01 and
minimize my cos function, now
using lambda equals 0.01
of course, to get some
different parameter vector theta,
we need to know that theta 2,
and for that I
end up with theta 3
so that this is correct for my
third model, and so on,
until for for my final model
with lambda set to 10,
or 10.24, or I end up with this theta 12.
Next I can take
all of these hypotheses, all of
these parameters, and use
my cross-validation set to evaluate them.
So I can look at my
first model, my second
model, fits with these different values
of the regularization parameter and
evaluate them on my cross-validation
set - basically measure the average squared error of each of these parameter
vectors theta on my cross-validation set.
And I would then pick whichever one
of these 12 models gives me
the lowest error on the cross-validation set.
And let's say, for the sake
of this example, that I
end up picking theta 5,
the fifth order polynomial, because
that has the Noah's cross-validation error.
Having done that, finally, what
I would do if I want
to report a test set error
is to take the parameter theta
5 that I've
selected and look at
how well it does on my test set.
And once again here is as
if we fit this parameter
theta to my cross-validation
set, which is why I
am saving aside a separate
test set that I
am going to use to get
a better estimate of how
well my a parameter vector
theta will generalize to previously unseen examples.
So that's model selection applied
to selecting the regularization parameter
lambda. The last thing
I'd like to do in this
video, is get a
better understanding of how
cross-validation and training error
vary as we as
we vary the regularization parameter lambda.
And so just a reminder, that
was our original cosine function j of
theta, but for this
purpose we're going to define
training error without using
the regularization parameter, and cross-validation
error without using the
regularization parameter and what I'd like
to do is plot this J train
and plot this Jcv, meaning just
how well does my
hypothesis do for on
the training set and how well
does my hypothesis do on the
cross-validation set as I
vary my regularization parameter
lambda so as
we saw earlier, if lambda
is small, then we're
not using much regularization and
we run a larger risk of overfitting.
Where as if lambda is
large, that is if we
were on the right part
of this horizontal axis, then
with a large value of lambda
we run the high risk of having a bias problem.
So if you plot J train
and Jcv, what you
find is that for small
values of lambda you can
fit the training set relatively
well because you're not regularizing.
So, for small values of
lambda, the regularization term basically
goes away and you're just
minimizing pretty much your squared error.
So when lambda is small, you
end up with a small value
for J train, whereas if
lambda is large, then you
have a high bias problem and you might not fit your training set so well.
So you end up with a value up there.
So, J train of
theta will tend to
increase when lambda increases
because a large value of
lambda corresponds a high bias
where you might not even fit your
training set well, whereas a
small value of lambda corresponds to,
if you can you know freely
fit to very high degree polynomials, your data, let's say.
As for the cross-validation error, we end up with a figure like this.
Where, over here on
the right, if we
have a large value of lambda,
we may end up underfitting.
And so, this is the bias regime
whereas and cross
validation error will be
high and let me just leave
all that. So, that's Jcv of theta because with
high bias we won't be fitting.
We won't be doing well on the cross-validation set.
Whereas here on the left, this is the high-variance regime.
Where if we have two smaller
value of then we
may be overfitting the data
and so by over fitting the
data then it a cross validation error
will also be high.
And so, this is what the
cross-validation error and what
the training error may look
like on a training set
as we vary the parameter
lambda, as we vary the regularization parameter lambda.
And so, once again, it will
often be some intermediate value
of lambda that you know, subsequent just right
or that works best in
terms of having a small
cross-validation error or a small test set error.
And whereas the curves I've drawn
here are somewhat cartoonish and somewhat idealized.
So on a real data set
the pros you get may
end up looking a little bit more
messy and just a little bit more noisy than this.
For some data sets you will
really see these poor
source of trends and
by looking at the plot
of the whole or cross validation
error, you can either
manually, automatically try to
select a point that minimizes
the cross-validation error and
select the value of lambda corresponding
to low cross-validation error.
When I'm trying to pick the
regularization parameter lambda
for a learning algorithm, often I
find that plotting a figure
like this one showed here, helps
me understand better what's going
on and helps me verify that
I am indeed picking a good
value for the regularization parameter
lambda. So hopefully that
gives you more insight into regularization
and it's effects on the bias
and variance of the learning algorithm.
By know you've seen bias and
variance from a lot of different perspectives.
And what I'd like to do
in the next video is take
a lot of the insights
that we've gone through and build
on them to put together
a diagnostic that's called learning
curves, which is a
tool that I often use
to try to diagnose if a
learning algorithm may be suffering
from a bias problem or a
variance problem or a little bit of both.

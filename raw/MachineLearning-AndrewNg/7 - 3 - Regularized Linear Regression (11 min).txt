For linear regression, we had
previously worked out two learning
algorithms, one based on
gradient descent and one based on the normal equation.
In this video we will take
those two algorithms and generalize
them to the case of regularized
linear regression. Here's the
optimization objective, that we
came up with last time for regularized linear regression.
This first part is our
usual, objective for linear regression,
and we now have this additional
regularization term, where londer
is our regularization parameter, and
we like to find parameters theta,
that minimizes this cost function,
this regularized cost function, J of theta.
Previously, we were using
gradient descent for the original
cost function, without the regularization
term, and we had
the following algorithm for regular
linear regression, without regularization.
We will repeatedly update the
parameters theta J as follows
for J equals 1,2 up
through n. Let me
take this and just write
the case for theta zero separately.
So, you know, I'm just gonna
write the update for theta
zero separately, then for
the update for the parameters
1, 2, 3, and so on up
to n. So, I haven't changed anything yet, right?
This is just writing the update
for theta zero separately from the
updates from theta 1, theta
2, theta 3, up to theta n. And
the reason I want to do this
is you may remember
that for our regularized linear regression,
we penalize the parameters theta
1, theta 2, and so
on up to theta n, but we don't penalize theta zero.
So when we modify this
algorithm for regularized
linear regression, we're going to
end up treating theta zero slightly differently.
Concretely, if we
want to take this algorithm and
modify it to use the
regularized objective, all we
need to do is take this
term at the bottom and modify as follows.
We're gonna take this term and add
minus londer M,
times theta J. And
if you implement this, then you
have gradient descent for trying
to minimize the regularized cost
function J of F theta, and concretely,
I'm not gonna do the
calculus to prove it, but
concretely if you look
at this term, this term that's written is square brackets.
If you know calculus, it's possible
to prove that that term is
the partial derivative, with respect of
J of theta, using the new
definition of J of theta
with the regularization term.
And somebody on this
term up on top,
which I guess I am
drawing the salient box
that's still the partial derivative
respect of theta zero for J of theta.
If you look at the update for
theta J, it's possible to
show's something pretty interesting, concretely
theta J gets updated as
theta J, minus alpha times,
and then you have this other term
here that depends on theta J
. So if you
group all the terms together
that depending on theta J. We
can show that this update can
be written equivalently as
follows and all I did
was have, you know, theta J
here is theta J times
1 and this term is
londer over M. There's also an alpha
here, so you end up
with alpha londer over
m, multiply them to
theta J and this term here, one minus
alpha times londer M, is
a pretty interesting term, it has a pretty interesting effect.
Concretely, this term one
minus alpha times londer over
M, is going to be
a number that's, you know, usually a number
that's a loop and less than 1,
right? Because of
alpha times londer over M is
going to be positive and usually, if you're learning rate is small and M is large.
That's usually pretty small.
So this term here, it's going
to be a number, it's usually, you know, a little bit less than one.
So think of it as
a number like 0.99, let's say
and so, the effect of our
updates of theta J is we're
going to say that theta J
gets replaced by thetata J times 0.99.
Alright so theta J
times 0.99 has the effect of
shrinking theta J a little bit towards 0.
So this makes theta J a bit smaller.
More formally, this you know, this
square norm of theta J
is smaller and then
after that the second
term here, that's actually
exactly the same as the
original gradient descent updated that we had.
Before we added all this regularization stuff.
So, hopefully this gradient
descent, hopefully this update makes
sense, when we're using regularized linear
regression what we're doing is on
every regularization were multiplying data
J by a number that
is a little bit less than one, so
we're shrinking the parameter a
little bit, and then we're
performing a, you know, similar update as before.
Of course that's just the
intuition behind what this particular update is doing.
Mathematically, what it's doing
is exactly gradient descent on
the cost function J of theta
that we defined on the previous
slide that uses the regularization term.
Gradient descent was just
one our two algorithms for
fitting a linear regression model.
The second algorithm was the
one based on the normal
equation where, what we
did was we created the
design matrix "x" where each
row corresponded to a separate training example.
And we created a vector
Y, so this is
a vector that is an
M dimensional vector and that
contain the labels from a training set.
So whereas X is an
M by N plus 1 dimensional matrix.
Y is an M dimensional
vector and in order
to minimize the cost
function change we found
that of one way
to do is to set
theta to be equal to this.
We have X transpose X,
inverse X transpose Y.
I am leaving room here, to fill
in stuff of course. And what this
value for theta does, is
this minimizes the cost
function J of theta when
we were not using regularization. Now
that we are using regularization, if
you were to derive what the
minimum is, and just to
give you a sense of how to
derive the minimum, the way
you derive it is you know,
take partial derivatives in respect
to each parameter, set this
to zero, and then do
a bunch of math, and you can
then show that is a formula
like this that minimizes the cost function.
And concretely, if you
are using regularization then this
formula changes as follows. Inside this
parenthesis, you end up with a matrix like this.
Zero, one, one, one
and so on, one until the bottom.
So this thing over here is
a matrix, who's upper leftmost entry is zero.
There's ones on the diagonals and
then the zeros everywhere else on this matrix.
Because I am drawing this a little bit sloppy.
But as a concrete
example if N equals 2,
then this matrix
is going to be a three by three matrix.
More generally, this matrix is
a N plus one
by N plus one dimensional matrix.
So then N equals two then that
matrix becomes something that looks like this.
Zero, and then ones
on the diagonals, and then
zeros on the rest of the diagonals.
And once again, you know, I'm not going to those this derivation.
Which is frankly somewhat long and involved.
But it is possible to prove
that if you are
using the new definition of
J of theta, with the regularization objective.
Then this new formula for
theta is the one
that will give you the global minimum of J of theta.
So finally, I want to
just quickly describe the issue of non-invertibility.
This is relatively advanced material.
So you should consider this as
optional and feel free
to skip it or if you
listen to it and you know, possibly it
don't really make sense, don't worry about it either.
But earlier when I talked the normal equation method.
We also had an optional video
on the non-invertability issue.
So this is another optional part,
that is sort of add on
earlier optional video on non-invertibility.
Now considering setting where M
the number of examples is less
than or equal to N the number features.
If you have fewer examples then
features then this matrix
X transpose X will be
non-invertible or singular, or
the other term
for this is the matrix will
be degenerate and if
you implement this in Octave
anyway, and you use the
P in function to take the psuedo inverse.
It will kind of do the
right thing that is not
clear that it will
give you a very good hypothesis
even though numerically the octave
P in function
will give you a result that
kind of makes sense.
But, if you were doing this in a different language.
And if you were
taking just the regular inverse
which an octave is denoted with the function INV.
We're trying to take the regular
inverse of X transpose X,
then in this setting you
find that X transpose X
is singular, is non-invertible and
if you're doing this in a different
programming language and using some
linear algebra library try to take the inverse of this matrix.
It just might not work because that
matrix is non-invertible or singular.
Fortunately, regularization also takes
care of this for us, and concretely, so
long as the regularization parameter is strictly greater than zero.
It is actually possible to
prove that this matrix X
transpose X plus parameter time, you know,s
this funny matrix here,
is possible to prove that this
matrix will not be
singular and that this matrix will be invertible.
So using regularization also takes
care of any non-invertibility issues
of the X transpose X matrix as well.
So, you now know how to implement regularize linear regression.
Using this, you'll be able
to avoid overfitting, even
if you have lots of features in a relatively small training set.
And this should let you get
linear regression to work much better for many problems.
In the next video, we'll take
this regularization idea and apply it to logistic regression.
So that you'll be able to
get logistic impression to avoid
overfitting and perform much better as well.

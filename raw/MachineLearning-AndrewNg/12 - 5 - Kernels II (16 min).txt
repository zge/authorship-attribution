In the last video, we started
to talk about the kernels idea
and how it can be used to
define new features for the support vector machine.
In this video, I'd like to throw
in some of the missing details and,
also, say a few words about
how to use these ideas in practice.
Such as, how they pertain
to, for example, the bias variance trade-off in support vector machines.
In the last video, I talked
about the process of picking a few landmarks.
You know, l1, l2, l3 and that
allowed us to define the
similarity function also called
the kernel or in this
example if you have
this similarity function this is a Gaussian kernel.
And that allowed us to build
this form of a hypothesis function.
But where do we get these landmarks from?
Where do we get l1, l2, l3 from?
And it seems, also, that for complex learning
problems, maybe we want a
lot more landmarks than just three of them that we might choose by hand.
So in practice this is
how the landmarks are chosen
which is that given the
machine learning problem. We have some
data set of some some positive
and negative examples. So, this is the idea here
which is that we're gonna take the
examples and for every
training example that we have,
we are just going to call
it. We're just going
to put landmarks as exactly
the same locations as the training examples.
So if I have one training
example if that is x1,
well then I'm going
to choose this is my first landmark
to be at xactly the same location
as my first training example.
And if I have a different training
example x2. Well we're
going to set the second landmark
to be the location of my second training example.
On the figure on the right, I
used red and blue dots
just as illustration, the color
of this figure, the color of
the dots on the figure on the right is not significant.
But what I'm going to end up
with using this method is I'm
going to end up with m
landmarks of l1, l2
down to l(m) if I
have m training examples with
one landmark per location of
my per location of each
of my training examples. And this is
nice because it is saying that
my features are basically going
to measure how close an
example is to one
of the things I saw in my training set.
So, just to write this outline a
little more concretely, given m
training examples, I'm going
to choose the the location
of my landmarks to be exactly
near the locations of my m training examples.
When you are given example x,
and in this example x can be
something in the training set,
it can be something in the cross validation
set, or it can be something in the test set.
Given an example x we are
going to compute, you know,
these features as so f1,
f2, and so on.
Where l1 is actually equal
to x1 and so on.
And these then give me a feature vector.
So let me write f as the feature vector.
I'm going to take these f1, f2 and
so on, and just group
them into feature vector.
Take those down to fm.
And, you know, just by convention.
If we want, we can add an
extra feature f0, which is always equal to 1.
So this plays a role similar to what we had previously.
For x0, which was our interceptor.
So, for example, if we
have a training example x(i), y(i),
the features we would compute for
this training example will be
as follows: given x(i), we
will then map it to, you know, f1(i).
Which is the similarity. I'm going to
abbreviate as SIM instead of writing out the whole
word
similarity, right?
And f2(i) equals the similarity
between x(i) and l2,
and so on,
down to fm(i) equals
the similarity between x(i) and l(m).
And somewhere in the middle.
Somewhere in this list, you know, at
the i-th component, I will
actually have one feature
component which is f subscript
i(i), which is
going to be the similarity
between x and l(i).
Where l(i) is equal to
x(i), and so you know
fi(i) is just going to
be the similarity between x and itself.
And if you're using the Gaussian kernel this is
actually e to the minus 0
over 2 sigma squared and so, this will be equal to 1 and that's okay.
So one of my features for this
training example is going to be equal to 1.
And then similar to what I have above.
I can take all of these
m features and group them into a feature vector.
So instead of representing my example,
using, you know, x(i) which is this what
R(n) plus R(n) one dimensional vector.
Depending on whether you can
set terms, is either R(n)
or R(n) plus 1.
We can now instead represent my
training example using this feature
vector f. I am
going to write this f superscript i.  Which
is going to be taking all
of these things and stacking them into a vector.
So, f1(i) down
to fm(i) and if you want and
well, usually we'll also add this
f0(i), where
f0(i) is equal to 1.
And so this vector
here gives me my
new feature vector with which
to represent my training example.
So given these kernels
and similarity functions, here's how
we use a simple vector machine.
If you already have a learning
set of parameters theta, then if you given a value of x and you want to make a prediction.
What we do is we compute the
features f, which is now
an R(m) plus 1 dimensional feature vector.
And we have m here because we have
m training examples and thus
m landmarks and what
we do is we predict
1 if theta transpose f
is greater than or equal to 0.
Right.
So, if theta transpose f, of course,
that's just equal to theta 0, f0 plus theta 1,
f1 plus dot dot
dot, plus theta m
f(m). And so my
parameter vector theta is also now
going to be an m
plus 1 dimensional vector.
And we have m here because where
the number of landmarks is equal
to the training set size.
So m was the training set size and now, the
parameter vector theta is going to be m plus one dimensional.
So that's how you make a prediction
if you already have a setting for the parameter's theta.
How do you get the parameter's theta?
Well you do that using the
SVM learning algorithm, and specifically
what you do is you would solve this minimization problem.
You've minimized the parameter's
theta of C times this cost function which we had before.
Only now, instead of looking
there instead of making
predictions using theta transpose
x(i) using our original
features, x(i). Instead we've
taken the features x(i)
and replace them with a new features
so we are using theta transpose
f(i) to make a
prediction on the i'f training
examples and we see that, you know,
in both places here and
it's by solving this minimization problem
that you get the parameters for your Support Vector Machine.
And one last detail is
because this optimization
problem we really have
n equals m features.
That is here.
The number of features we have.
Really, the effective number of
features we have is dimension
of f. So that n
is actually going to be equal
to m. So, if you want to, you can
think of this as a sum,
this really is a sum
from j equals 1 through
m. And then one way to think
about this, is you can
think of it as n being
equal to m, because if
f isn't a new feature, then
we have m plus 1
features, with the plus 1 coming from the interceptor.
And here, we still do sum
from j equal 1 through n,
because similar to our
earlier videos on regularization,
we still do not regularize the
parameter theta zero, which is
why this is a sum for
j equals 1 through m
instead of j equals zero though
m.  So that's
the support vector machine learning algorithm.
That's one sort of, mathematical
detail aside that I
should mention, which is
that in the way the support
vector machine is implemented, this last
term is actually done a little bit differently.
So you don't really need to
know about this last detail in
order to use support vector machines,
and in fact the equations that
are written down here should give
you all the intuitions that should need.
But in the way the support vector machine
is implemented, you know, that term, the
sum of j of theta j squared right?
Another way to write this is this can
be written as theta transpose
theta if we ignore
the parameter theta 0.
So theta 1 down to
theta m.  Ignoring theta 0.
Then this sum of
j of theta j squared that this
can also be written theta transpose theta.
And what most support vector
machine implementations do is actually
replace this theta transpose theta,
will instead, theta transpose times
some matrix inside, that depends
on the kernel you use, times theta.
And so this gives us a slightly different distance metric.
We'll use a slightly different
measure instead of minimizing exactly
the norm of theta squared means
that minimize something slightly similar to it.
That's like a rescale version of
the parameter vector theta that depends on the kernel.
But this is kind of a mathematical detail.
That allows the support vector
machine software to run much more efficiently.
And the reason the support vector machine
does this is with this modification.
It allows it to
scale to much bigger training sets.
Because for example, if you have
a training set with 10,000 training examples.
Then, you know, the way we define
landmarks, we end up with 10,000 landmarks.
And so theta becomes 10,000 dimensional.
And maybe that works, but when m
becomes really, really big
then solving for all
of these parameters, you know, if m were
50,000 or a 100,000
then solving for
all of these parameters can become
expensive for the support
vector machine optimization software, thus
solving the minimization problem that I drew here.
So kind of as mathematical
detail, which again you really don't need to know about.
It actually modifies that last
term a little bit to
optimize something slightly different than
just minimizing the norm squared of theta squared, of theta.
But if you want,
you can feel free to think
of this as an kind of a n implementational detail
that does change the objective a
bit, but is done primarily
for reasons of computational efficiency,
so usually you don't really have to worry about this.
And by the way, in case your
wondering why we don't apply
the kernel's idea to other
algorithms as well like logistic
regression, it turns out
that if you want, you
can actually apply the kernel's
idea and define the source
of features using landmarks and so on for logistic regression.
But the computational tricks that apply
for support vector machines don't
generalize well to other algorithms like logistic regression.
And so, using kernels with
logistic regression is going too
very slow, whereas, because of
computational tricks, like that
embodied and how it modifies
this and the details of how
the support vector machine software is
implemented, support vector machines and
kernels tend go particularly well together.
Whereas, logistic regression and kernels,
you know, you can do it, but this would run very slowly.
And it won't be able to
take advantage of advanced optimization
techniques that people have figured
out for the particular case
of running a support vector machine with a kernel.
But all this pertains only
to how you actually implement
software to minimize the cost function.
I will say more about that in
the next video, but you really don't
need to know about
how to write software to
minimize this  cost function because
you can find very good off the shelf software for doing so.
And just as, you know, I wouldn't
recommend writing code to invert
a matrix or to compute a
square root, I actually do
not recommend writing software to
minimize this cost function yourself,
but instead to use off
the shelf software packages that people
have developed and so
those software packages already embody
these numerical optimization tricks,
so you don't really have to worry about them.
But one other thing that is
worth knowing about is when
you're applying a support vector
machine, how do you
choose the parameters of the support vector machine?
And the last thing I want to
do in this video is say a
little word about the bias and
variance trade offs when using a support vector machine.
When using an SVM, one of
the things you need to choose is
the parameter C which
was in the optimization objective, and
you recall that C played a
role similar to 1 over
lambda, where lambda was the regularization
parameter we had for logistic regression.
So, if you have a
large value of C, this corresponds
to what we have back in logistic
regression, of a small
value of lambda meaning of not using much regularization.
And if you do that, you
tend to have a hypothesis with lower bias and higher variance.
Whereas if you use a smaller
value of C then this
corresponds to when we
are using logistic regression with a
large value of lambda and that corresponds
to a hypothesis with higher
bias and lower variance.
And so, hypothesis with large
C has a higher
variance, and is more prone
to overfitting, whereas hypothesis with
small C has higher bias
and is thus more prone to underfitting.
So this parameter C is one of the parameters we need to choose.
The other one is the parameter
sigma squared, which appeared in the Gaussian kernel.
So if the Gaussian kernel
sigma squared is large, then
in the similarity function, which
was this you know E to the
minus x minus landmark
varies squared over 2 sigma squared.
In this one of the example; If I
have only one feature, x1, if
I have a landmark there at
that location, if sigma
squared is large, then, you know, the
Gaussian kernel would tend to
fall off relatively slowly
and so this would be my feature
f(i), and so this
would be smoother function that varies
more smoothly, and so this will
give you a hypothesis with higher
bias and lower variance, because
the Gaussian kernel that falls off smoothly,
you tend to get a hypothesis that
varies slowly, or varies smoothly
as you change the
input x. Whereas in contrast,
if sigma squared was
small and if that's my
landmark given my 1
feature x1, you know, my Gaussian
kernel, my similarity function, will vary more abruptly.
And in both cases I'd pick
out 1, and so if sigma squared
is small, then my features vary less smoothly.
So if it's just higher slopes
or higher derivatives here.
And using this, you end
up fitting hypotheses of lower
bias and you can have higher variance.
And if you look at this
week's points exercise, you actually get
to play around with some
of these ideas yourself and see these effects yourself.
So, that was the support vector machine with kernels algorithm.
And hopefully this discussion of
bias and variance will give
you some sense of how you
can expect this algorithm to behave as well.

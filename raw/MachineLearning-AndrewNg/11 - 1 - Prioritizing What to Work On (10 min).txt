In the next few videos I'd
like to talk about machine learning system design.
These videos will touch on
the main issues that you may
face when designing a
complex machine learning system,
and will actually try to give
advice on how to
strategize putting together a complex machine learning system.
In case this next set
of videos seems a little
disjointed that's because these
videos will touch on a
range of the different issues that
you may come across when designing complex learning systems.
And even though the
next set of videos may seem
somewhat less mathematical, I think
that this material may turn
out to be very useful, and
potentially huge time savers
when you're building big machine learning systems.
Concretely, I'd like to
begin with the issue of
prioritizing how to spend
your time on what to work
on, and I'll begin
with an example on spam classification.
Let's say you want to build a spam classifier.
Here are a couple of examples
of obvious spam and non-spam emails.
if the one on the left tried to sell things.
And notice how spammers
will deliberately misspell words,
like Vincent with a 1 there, and mortgages.
And on the right as maybe
an obvious example of non-stamp
email, actually email from my younger brother.
Let's say we have a labeled
training set of some
number of spam emails and
some non-spam emails denoted
with labels y equals 1 or 0,
how do we build a
classifier using supervised learning
to distinguish between spam and non-spam?
In order to apply supervised learning,
the first decision we must
make is how do
we want to represent x, that
is the features of the email.
Given the features x and
the labels y in our
training set, we can then
train a classifier, for example using logistic regression.
Here's one way to choose
a set of features for our emails.
We could come up with,
say, a list of maybe
a hundred words that we think
are indicative of whether e-mail
is spam or non-spam, for
example, if a piece of
e-mail contains the word 'deal'
maybe it's more likely to be
spam if it contains
the word  'buy' maybe more
likely to be spam, a
word like 'discount' is more
likely to be spam, whereas if
a piece of email contains my name,
Andrew, maybe that means
the person actually knows who
I am and that might mean it's
less likely to be spam.
And maybe for some reason I think
the word "now" may be
indicative of non-spam because
I get a lot of urgent
emails, and so on,
and maybe we choose a hundred words or so.
Given a piece of email,
we can then take this piece
of email and encode
it into a feature
vector as follows.
I'm going to take my list of a
hundred words and sort
them in alphabetical order say.
It doesn't have to be sorted.
But, you know, here's a, here's
my list of words, just count
and so on, until eventually
I'll get down to now, and so
on and given a piece
of e-mail like that shown on the
right, I'm going to
check and see whether or
not each of these words
appears in the e-mail and then
I'm going to define a feature
vector x where in
this piece of an email on
the right, my name doesn't
appear so I'm gonna put a zero there.
The word "by" does appear,
so I'm gonna put a one there
and I'm just gonna put one's or zeroes.
I'm gonna put a
one even though the word "by" occurs twice.
I'm not gonna recount how many times the word occurs.
The word "due" appears, I put a one there.
The word "discount" doesn't appear, at
least not in this this little
short email, and so on.
The word "now" does appear and so on.
So I put ones and zeroes
in this feature vector depending on
whether or not a particular word appears.
And in this example my
feature vector would have
to mention one hundred,
if I have a hundred,
if if I chose a hundred
words to use for
this representation and each
of my features Xj will
basically be 1 if
you have a particular word that,
we'll call this word j, appears
in the email and Xj
would be zero otherwise.
Okay.
So that gives me
a feature representation of a piece of email.
By the way, even though I've
described this process as manually
picking a hundred words, in
practice what's most commonly
done is to look through
a training set, and in
the training set depict the
most frequently occurring n words
where n is usually between ten
thousand and fifty thousand, and use
those as your features.
So rather than manually picking a
hundred words, here you look
through the training examples and
pick the most frequently occurring words
like ten thousand to fifty thousand
words, and those form the
features that you are going
to use to represent your email for spam classification.
Now, if you're building a
spam classifier one question
that you may face is, what's
the best use of your time
in order to make your
spam classifier have higher accuracy, you have lower error.
One natural inclination is going to collect lots of data.
Right?
And in fact there's this tendency
to think that, well the
more data we have the better the algorithm will do.
And in fact, in the email
spam domain, there are actually
pretty serious projects called Honey
Pot Projects, which create fake
email addresses and try to
get these fake email addresses into
the hands of spammers and use
that to try to collect tons
of spam email, and therefore
you know, get a lot of spam data to train learning algorithms.
But we've already seen in the
previous sets of videos
that getting lots of data will often help, but not all the time.
But for most machine learning problems,
there are a lot of other things
you could usually imagine doing to improve performance.
For spam, one thing you
might think of is to develop
more sophisticated features on the
email, maybe based on the email routing information.
And this would be information contained in the email header.
So, when spammers send email,
very often they will try
to obscure the origins of
the email, and maybe
use fake email headers.
Or send email through very
unusual sets of computer service.
Through very unusual routes, in order to get the spam to you.
And some of this information will be reflected in the email header.
And so one can imagine,
looking at the email headers and
trying to develop more sophisticated features
to capture this sort of
email routing information to identify if something is spam.
Something else you might consider doing
is to look at the
email message body, that is
the email text, and try to develop more sophisticated features.
For example, should the word
'discount' and the word
'discounts' be treated as
the same words or should
we have treat the words 'deal' and 'dealer' as the same word?
Maybe even though one is
lower case and one in capitalized in this example.
Or do we want more complex features about punctuation because maybe spam
is using exclamation marks a lot more.
I don't know.
And along the same lines, maybe
we also want to develop more
sophisticated algorithms to detect
and maybe to correct to deliberate misspellings,
like mortgage, medicine, watches.
Because spammers actually do this,
because if you have watches
with a 4 in there then well,
with the simple technique that we
talked about just now, the spam
classifier might not equate
this as the same thing as the
word "watches," and so it
may have a harder time realizing
that something is spam with these deliberate misspellings.
And this is why spammers do it.
While working on a machine learning
problem, very often you
can brainstorm lists of different things to try, like these.
By the way, I've actually
worked on the spam
problem myself for a while.
And I actually spent quite some time on it.
And even though I kind
of understand the spam problem,
I actually know a bit about it,
I would actually have a very
hard time telling you of
these four options which is
the best use of your time
so what happens, frankly what
happens far too often is
that a research group or
product group will randomly fixate on one of these options.
And sometimes that turns
out not to be the most
fruitful way to spend your
time depending, you know, on which
of these options someone ends up randomly fixating on.
By the way, in fact, if
you even get to the stage
where you brainstorm a list
of different options to try, you're
probably already ahead of the curve.
Sadly, what most people do is
instead of trying to list
out the options of things
you might try, what far too
many people do is wake up
one morning and, for some
reason, just, you know, have a weird
gut feeling that, "Oh let's
have a huge honeypot project
to go and collect tons more data"
and for whatever strange reason just
sort of wake up one morning and randomly
fixate on one thing and just
work on that for six months.
But I think we can do better.
And in particular what I'd
like to do in the next
video is tell you about
the concept of error analysis
and talk about the way
where you can try
to have a more systematic way
to choose amongst the options
of the many different things you
might work, and therefore be
more likely to select what
is actually a good way
to spend your time, you know
for the next few weeks, or next few days or the next few months.

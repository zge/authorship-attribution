In the previous video, I talked
about error analysis and the
importance of having error
metrics, that is of having
a single real number evaluation metric
for your learning algorithm to tell how well it's doing.
In the context of evaluation
and of error metrics, there is
one important case, where it's
particularly tricky to come
up with an appropriate error metric,
or evaluation metric, for your learning algorithm.
That case is the case
of what's called skewed classes.
Let me tell you what that means.
Consider the problem of cancer
classification, where we have
features of medical patients and
we want to decide whether or not they have cancer.
So this is like the malignant
versus benign tumor classification
example that we had earlier.
So let's say y equals 1 if the
patient has cancer and y equals 0
if they do not.
We have trained the progression
classifier and let's say
we test our classifier on
a test set and find that we get 1 percent error.
So, we're making 99% correct diagnosis.
Seems like a really impressive result, right.
We're correct 99% percent of the time.
But now, let's say we find
out that only 0.5 percent
of patients in our
training test sets actually have cancer.
So only half a
percent of the patients that
come through our screening process have cancer.
In this case, the 1%
error no longer looks so impressive.
And in particular, here's a piece
of code, here's actually a piece
of non learning code that takes
this input of features x and it ignores it.
It just sets y equals 0
and always predicts, you
know, nobody has cancer and this
algorithm would actually get
0.5 percent error.
So this is even better than
the 1% error that we were getting just now
and this is a non
learning algorithm that you know, it is just
predicting y equals 0 all the time.
So this setting of when
the ratio of positive to
negative examples is very close
to one of two extremes, where,
in this case, the number of
positive examples is much,
much smaller than the number
of negative examples because y
equals one so rarely, this
is what we call the
case of skewed classes.
We just have a lot more
of examples from one class
than from the other class.
And by just predicting y equals
0 all the time, or maybe
our predicting y equals 1
all the time, an algorithm can do pretty well.
So the problem with using
classification error or classification
accuracy as our evaluation metric is the following.
Let's say you have one joining
algorithm that's getting 99.2% accuracy.
So, that's a 0.8% error.
Let's say you
make a change to your algorithm
and you now are getting
99.5% accuracy.
That is 0.5% error.
So, is this an improvement to the algorithm or not?
One of the nice things
about having a single real
number evaluation metric is this
helps us to quickly decide if
we just need a good change to the algorithm or not.
By going from 99.2% accuracy to 99.5% accuracy.
You know, did we just do something
useful or did we
just replace our code with
something that just predicts y equals
zero more often?
So, if you have very skewed classes
it becomes much harder to use
just classification accuracy, because you
can get very high classification accuracies
or very low errors, and
it's not always clear if
doing so is really improving
the quality of your classifier
because predicting y equals 0 all the
time doesn't seem like
a particularly good classifier.
But just predicting y equals 0 more
often can bring your error
down to, you know, maybe as
low as 0.5%.
When we're faced with such
a skewed classes therefore we
would want to come up
with a different error metric
or a different evaluation metric.
One such evaluation metric are
what's called precision recall.
Let me explain what that is.
Let's say we are evaluating a classifier on the test set.
For the examples in the
test set the actual
class of that example
in the test set is going to
be either one or zero, right,
if there is a binary classification problem.
And what our learning algorithm
will do is it will, you know,
predict some value for the
class and our learning
algorithm will predict the value
for each example in my
test set and the predicted value
will also be either one or zero.
So let me draw a two
by two table as follows,
depending on a full of these entries
depending on what was the
actual class and what was the predicted class.
If we have an
example where the actual class is
one and the predicted class
is one then that's called
an example that's a true
positive, meaning our algorithm
predicted that it's positive
and in reality the example is positive.
If our learning algorithm predicted that
something is negative, class zero,
and the actual class is also
class zero then that's what's called a true negative.
We predicted zero and it actually is zero.
To find the other two boxes,
if our learning algorithm predicts that
the class is one but the
actual class is zero, then
that's called a false positive.
So that means our algorithm for
the patient is cancelled out in
reality if the patient does not.
And finally, the last box is a zero, one.
That's called a false negative
because our algorithm predicted
zero, but the actual class was one.
And so, we
have this little sort of two by
two table based on
what was the actual class and what was the predicted class.
So here's a different way
of evaluating the performance of
our algorithm. We're
going to compute two numbers.
The first is called precision -
and what that says is,
of all the patients where we've
predicted that they have cancer,
what fraction of them actually have cancer?
So let me write this down,
the precision of a classifier
is the number of true
positives divided by
the number that we predicted
as positive, right?
So of all the patients that
we went to those patients and we told them, "We think you have cancer."
Of all those patients, what
fraction of them actually have cancer?
So that's called precision.
And another way to write this
would be true positives and
then in the denominator is the
number of predicted positives, and
so that would be the
sum of the, you know, entries
in this first row of the table.
So it would be true positives divided by true positives.
I'm going to abbreviate positive
as POS and then
plus false positives, again
abbreviating positive using POS.
So that's called precision, and as you
can tell high precision would be good.
That means that all the patients
that we went to and we said, "You know, we're very sorry.
We think you have cancer," high precision
means that of that group
of patients most of them
we had actually made accurate
predictions on them and they do have cancer.
The second number we're going to compute
is called recall, and what
recall say is, if all
the patients in, let's say,
in the test set or the
cross-validation set, but if
all the patients in the data
set that actually have cancer,
what fraction of them that
we correctly detect as having cancer.
So if all the patients have
cancer, how many of them
did we actually go to them
and you know, correctly told them that we think they need treatment.
So, writing this down,
recall is defined as the
number of positives, the number
of true positives,
meaning the number of people
that have cancer and that
we correctly predicted have cancer
and we take that and divide
that by, divide that by
the number of actual positives,
so this is the right
number of actual positives of all the people that do have cancer.
What fraction do we directly
flag and you know, send the treatment.
So, to rewrite this in
a different form, the denominator would
be the number of actual
positives as you know, is the sum
of the entries in this first column over here.
And so writing things out differently,
this is therefore, the number of
true positives, divided by
the number of true positives
plus the number of
false negatives.
And so once again, having a high recall would be a good thing.
So by computing precision and
recall this will usually
give us a better sense of
how well our classifier is doing.
And in particular if we have
a learning algorithm that predicts
y equals zero all
the time, if it predicts no
one has cancer, then this
classifier will have a
recall equal to zero,
because there won't be any
true positives and so that's
a quick way for us to
recognize that, you know, a
classifier that predicts y equals 0 all the time,
just isn't a very good classifier.
And more generally,
even for settings where we
have very skewed classes, it's
not possible for an
algorithm to sort of "cheat"
and somehow get a very
high precision and a
very high recall by doing
some simple thing like predicting
y equals 0 all the time or
predicting y equals 1 all the time.
And so we're much
more sure that a classifier
of a high precision or high recall
actually is a good classifier,
and this gives us a
more useful evaluation metric that
is a more direct way to
actually understand whether, you know, our algorithm may be doing well.
So one final note in
the definition of precision and
recall, that we would define
precision and recall, usually we
use the convention that y is equal to 1, in
the presence of the more rare class.
So if we are trying to detect.
rare conditions such as cancer,
hopefully that's a rare condition,
precision and recall are
defined setting y equals
1, rather than y
equals 0, to be sort of
that the presence of that rare
class that we're trying to detect.
And by using precision and recall,
we find, what happens is
that even if we have
very skewed classes, it's not
possible for an algorithm to
you know, "cheat" and predict
y equals 1 all the time,
or predict y equals 0 all
the time, and get high precision and recall.
And in particular, if a classifier
is getting high precision and high
recall, then we are
actually confident that the algorithm
has to be doing well, even
if we have very skewed classes.
So for the problem of skewed classes precision
recall gives us more
direct insight into how
the learning algorithm is doing
and this is often a much
better way to evaluate our learning algorithms,
than looking at classification error
or classification accuracy, when the classes are very skewed.

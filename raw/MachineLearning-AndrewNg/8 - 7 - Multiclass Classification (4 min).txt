In this video, I want to
tell you about how to use neural
networks to do multiclass
classification where we may
have more than one category
that we're trying to distinguish amongst.
In the last part of
the last video, where we
had the handwritten digit recognition
problem, that was actually
a multiclass classification problem because
there were ten possible categories
for recognizing the digits from
0 through 9 and so, if
you want us to fill you
in on the details of how to do that.
The way we do multiclass classification
in a neural network is essentially
an extension of the one versus all method.
So, let's say that we
have a computer vision example,
where instead of just trying
to recognize cars as in
the original example that I started off
with, but let's say that
we're trying to recognize, you know, four
categories of objects and given
an image we want to
decide if it is a pedestrian, a car, a motorcycle or a truck.
If that's the case, what
we would do is we would
build a neural network with four
output units so that
our neural network now outputs a vector of four numbers.
So, the output now is actually
needing to be a vector of four
numbers and what we're
going to try to do is
get the first output unit
to classify: is the
image a pedestrian, yes or no.
The second unit to classify: is the image a car, yes or no.
This unit to classify: is the
image a motorcycle, yes or
no, and this would classify:
is the image a truck, yes or no.
And thus, when the image
is of a pedestrian, we
would ideally want the network
to output 1, 0, 0, 0,
when it is a
car we want it to output
0, 1, 0, 0, when this
is a motorcycle, we get it to or rather, we want
it to output 0, 0,
1, 0 and so on.
So this is just like
the "one versus all" method
that we talked about when we
were describing logistic regression, and
here we have essentially four logistic
regression classifiers, each of
which is trying to recognize one
of the four classes that
we want to distinguish amongst.
So, rearranging the slide of
it, here's our neural network
with four output units and those
are what we want h
of x to be when we
have the different images, and
the way we're going to represent the
training set in these settings
is as follows. So, when we have
a training set with different images
of pedestrians, cars, motorcycles and
trucks, what we're going
to do in this example is
that whereas previously we had
written out the labels as
y being an integer from
1, 2, 3 or 4. Instead of
representing y this way,
we're going to instead represent y
as follows: namely Yi
will be either 1, 0, 0, 0
or 0, 1, 0, 0 or 0, 0, 1, 0 or 0, 0, 0, 1 depending on what the
corresponding image Xi is.
And so one training example
will be one pair Xi colon Yi
where Xi is an image with, you
know one of the four objects and
Yi will be one of these vectors.
And hopefully, we can find
a way to get our
Neural Networks to output some
value. So, the h of x
is approximately y and
both h of x and Yi,
both of these are going
to be in our example,
four dimensional vectors when we have four classes.
So, that's how you
get neural network to do multiclass classification.
This wraps up our discussion on
how to represent Neural Networks
that is on our hypotheses representation.
In the next set of videos, let's
start to talk about how take
a training set and how to
automatically learn the parameters of the neural network.

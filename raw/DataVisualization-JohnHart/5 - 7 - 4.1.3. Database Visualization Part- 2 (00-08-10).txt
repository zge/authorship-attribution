[SOUND].
So there's a nice connection between these
OLAP data cube operations and
various Infovis operations
that we've looked at,
for example in Shneiderman's mantra.
A common data cube operation is slicing.
And that's basically taking
a summarized axis or
some full axis and looking at
a specific value along that axis.
So, for example,
this could be the location axis,
and this data cube represents all of
your data across all the locations.
You can pick a particular location and
then start to look at just the data for
that particular location, that slicing.
And we do that in Infovis just by
filtering value along that dimension.
Similarly dicing, if we have the full
data cube representing all of the ranges,
we can limit those ranges by dicing,
by looking at sub cubes of the data cube.
And we do that in Infovis by setting
up filter ranges instead of ordinal or
nominal filter values, or individual
values, we have a range of values.
And if those values correspond to
the coordinates used for plotting,
then we do the same thing where
we zoom a plot area in Infovis.
So slicing could reduce
the dimension of the data cube.
We can also aggregate to reduce
the dimension of the data cube.
And so if we sum along, or find some other
aggregation measure in average across one
of the dimensions, then that reduces
the dimensionality of the data cube,
makes it easier to see the value.
That's the standard aggregation operation.
And then there is also disaggregation, and
when we aggregate the data in data cube
terminology we call that a roll-up.
We're rolling up all the values
into average values or
aggregate values here.
If we do the opposite operation
that's called a drill down,
we drill down into the details.
So we're disaggregating.
We're taking our average values here and
expanding them out to the data.
And we see this all the time
when we zoom on fields or
get details on demand in Tableau.
It's when we start dragging fields
on the shelves in order to expand,
based on the dimensions
associated with those fields.
And finally the pivot term,
and this is where pivot table
gets the term pivot from,
is basically a rotation of the data cube.
You're changing which faces your
looking at, you're swapping axes.
So you're changing the role of a dimension
on a particular visualization of the data.
We do that simply by field selection.
In Tableau,
we're just dragging fields around to see
what we're looking at
at any given instance.
We can show, for example, how all of
the data cube operations on a database,
in this case the data cube of
the world bank indicators,
how all of our data cube
operations can be implemented
using an information visualization tool,
in this case, Tableau.
So I'm displaying here a plot of
infant mortality over life expectancy,
and infant mortality is measured
over deaths per 1,000 children,
and so you want a lower infant mortality.
And this is the the infant
mortality rate and
the life expectancy average over the
dimensions of our dataset, basically time.
Our dataset is measures every year
over ten years, and then by country.
It's being averaged over
every country in the world.
And so we can look at the different data
cube operations we can apply to this
data cube, in our presentation,
for example, slicing.
So if I take this dataset and I expand it,
disaggregate it by region, we'll assign
region the color, I get the continents.
Basically I desegregate by continent.
And now we can see how each
of the continents is doing.
I can slice the dataset by looking at,
basically,
one data point and
I can keep only that data point.
That creates a filter operation
in our information tool that's
doing the slice operation.
We've sliced by a continent and
that continent represents
a collection of countries, and so
that operation is actually also performed,
the dice operation.
And by basically focusing on a range
of items, a sub cube, and so
we can see what countries are represented
by bringing over countries.
And so if I disaggregate by country, now
these averages are basically over time.
But each country represents an average
over time of the infant mortality and and
life expectancy of
the countries in Europe.
And so I've diced our dataset
into just the European portion.
And then we can roll these back up.
If you want to do a roll-up,
we're going to simplify,
we're going to aggregate again.
And so for example,
I can get rid of the country and
just look at Europe.
And that's sort of a roll-up of all
that data back into a summary view.
So we're averaging over all the countries
in Europe for that data point.
And then we can remove the dice and
slice operation and
just look at the original dataset.
Now we might want to drill down
into some of the details of this.
By drilling down,
we're doing the opposite of a roll-up.
Instead of aggregating by averaging or
summing, we're going to disaggregate
to drill down into the details.
We've already drilled
down into the regions,
we can also drill down into the date.
Each one of these dots represents
an average over ten years, for
each of these continents.
So I can disaggregate to drill
down into the performance
per year by just dragging into year here.
We can use a line plot to look
at this better and you can see
the trends that each of these continents
is basically improving over each year.
2005, 6, 7, 2009.
Each one of these continents is
improving its life expectancy.
Increasing its life expectancy,
decreasing its infant mortality.
And so we can drill down even
further by differentiating
each of these continents by
its individual countries.
And we get a plot like this, and so
we've drilled down into finer details for
each country in each continent.
And we can see how each
individual country is performing,
as it tries to reduce its infant mortality
and increase its life expectancy.
And then finally there's
the pivot operation,
if I go back to the continent view.
Pivot operation is basically
a rotation of the data cube.
We're differentiating by region here,
by continent here,
the performance of infant
mortality versus life expectancy.
I can cycle fields in Tableau and
that basically performs a rotation.
Now I'm coloring by year and
then by region,
so I've just cycled those fields.
And we can continue to
cycle the fields and
see different views of our data based
on different rotations of the data cube.

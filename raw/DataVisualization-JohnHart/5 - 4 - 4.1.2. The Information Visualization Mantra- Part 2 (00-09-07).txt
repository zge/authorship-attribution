[SOUND] So the next step of
the mantra is Zoom and Filter.
So let's look at zooming.
What does zooming do?
Zooming helps us focus on
a portion of the plotted data.
It removes extraneous data that's
outside of our zoomed in area.
So here's an example of a plot of
data across the United States.
And in this case, we've zoomed in on
a portion of the West to the Midwest.
And then we've zoomed in again on
a portion of Northern California.
And by zooming in at each of these levels,
we're removing a large
portion of our dataset.
So we can focus on a smaller
portion of our dataset.
And by expanding that smaller portion
of our dataset to the entire screen,
it allows us to use the resolution of the
entire display to display more details.
So at the highest level, we're just
showing the state boundaries, but
as we zoom in,
we can start to show county boundaries.
And then at the finer level,
we have enough room to where we can
add the names of counties, and
other data about each of the counties.
And so by focusing on
a small portion of our data,
we can ignore large amounts of data.
And we can add more detail about
the data we're specifically looking at,
and so there's two ways of zooming.
There's this way where we're
looking at a portion of
the displayed coordinates of our datset
by, for example, clicking a window.
Or we can also expand axis fields.
So for example,
if you're plotting data over time,
you might be looking at it by year.
If you want to focus on the year 2014
then you could click on 2014, and
expand that into quarters.
And we could look at, say, the first three
quarters of 2014, and ignore 2013 and
2015.
So we can use our resolution to
more clearly see what's happening
at each quarter.
And then, we may be interested in Q2,
and you could expand that.
And look at the individual months,
April, May and June of Q2, and ignore,
for example, the months in Q1 and Q3.
So in each of these cases, zooming
allows us to take the displayed data,
and to expand it to be able to focus
on a portion of the displayed data.
And ignore the rest of our dataset that's
not in that subset of our displayed data.
So here we've used Tableau to plot our
life expectancy data versus population for
every country in the world, and
some of the data clumps up.
We have a big collection here of a bunch
of countries that have similar populations
and life expectancy.
And there's not enough resolution
to be able to know which
one we're pointing at if
we're looking at that.
So if I want to find out in these
clumpy areas what's going on,
I would zoom, and so
it would show the Zoom Controls.
Go over here and zoom in on this data,
and that will spread things out.
And I can see, for example,
this clump was Norway, Singapore,
and New Zealand that all have similar
populations and life expectancies.
And some of these other
clumps can be differentiated.
For example, West Bank,
and Gaza, and Lithuania
have similar life expectancy
in populations, or
over here we've got Argentina and Poland.
And so by zooming in on the data,
we can use the resolution available on our
Display Screen to better
differentiate similar items.
And then we can always zoom back if
we want to see where things are in
the original context.
When we zoom in on a portion of our
plotted data we're ignoring, we're
completely ignoring, the portion of the
data that's outside of that zoom window.
Often that can cause us
to get lost in the data.
We're looking at a fine level, and we
forget where that fine level of data that
we're focusing on sits
within the larger dataset.
So, there are tools that help us to
combine the focus of zooming with
the context of the big picture
of the entire dataset.
And, these are called lenses.
They're interactive lenses
that you can drag around.
Sometimes they're called magic lenses,
depending on what they show.
And they allow you to zoom in on details.
For example, here's a dataset, and
we can drag around this zoom lens.
And it uniformly magnifies
everything underneath it, but
you can still see where you
are relative to the large dataset.
But in this case,
we have a uniform level of magnification,
so the data that's underneath the
periphery of this lens is being obscured.
We're magnifying this portion
of the data but for example,
we've really lost the detail of the region
of data away from that magnified edge.
Because it's being obscured
by the magnified data.
There are fisheye distortion
lenses that help fix that problem.
In a fisheye lens, you've got a lot of
magnification at the center of the lens.
And as you move away from the center,
you've got less magnification.
And as you get towards the periphery
of the lens, you get no magnification.
The magnification goes to one, and so
you basically as you cross the lens,
you don't see any change in magnification.
That way we can push away some of
the details from the center, and
we get this seamless transition
from the outer context
into the zoom details
that we're looking at.
In this case, these three spheres,
these three light green spheres,
are the three large spheres that were
basically occluding everything here.
And as we push them away,
because they're away from the center,
we can start to magnify five very,
very small spheres that were being
occluded by these large spheres.
For example, these three spheres
are basically these three spheres.
They're uniformly distributed one,
two, three here, and
you can see that the first sphere here
is farther away than the other two.
That's because of the magnification
of this sphere is greater than
the magnification of these spheres.
And so the distance is getting
magnified more here than it was here.
And so these fisheye distortion
lenses give us a nice combination
of the ability to zoom in on data, but
to see it in a context of the big picture.
So the D3 JavaScript library
has some good tools for
doing a fisheye distortion
that nicely demonstrated.
So here, for example, we have a graph, and
you can see that the graph contains
a lot of clusters of nodes.
And it's hard to see what's going on with
all the edges inside those clusters.
But if I put the mouse near it,
than we get a magnification, and
you can start to see the differences.
There's still a lot of lines there,
but you can magnify the positions
of the nodes, spread the nodes out
with this fisheye distortion lens.
And see what's going on with the edges,
while still connecting to the context
of the remainder of the graph.
So you still get your big
picture of the whole graph.
You can zoom in on individual elements.
And later on in the page, they show
an example of how this distortion works.
It's basically creating a small vector
field that offsets the vertices or
pixels, depending on if you're looking
at primitive data, left vertices, or
if you're looking at
image data with pixels.
And then you can do
the lensing to the entire screen
in a rectal-linear way, or
you can just do it to a small cylindrical
or a small disk-shaped portion.
And here's some other data.
In this case, you've got data
that's plotted by area, and
there's a lot of overlap, and
a lot of small details and large details.
And as you drag over these regions,
by distorting the entire field, then
you can see the intricate relationship
between the data in your focus.
While still maintaining the context
of where that data lies
in the context of the rest of the dataset.
So these fisheye lenses provide a nice
compromise of both focus and context.

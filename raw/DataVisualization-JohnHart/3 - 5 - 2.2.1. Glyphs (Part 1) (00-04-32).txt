So when we visualize data,
we're plotting the data.
And then we need to figure out what we're
going to use to represent each piece
of data.
That piece of data we're
going to call a glyph
when it's represented visually
as part of a data visualization.
So as we saw before, charts display data,
and the choice of chart and the elements
of a chart are often dependent on the
kinds of data that we want to indicate.
We can use glyphs in charts to further
display data, either new data or
to reinforce existing data.
For example, the shapes at the top of
a bar chart, or the actual shapes of
the bars in a bar chart or a Gantt
chart can change based on the data.
In this case, the thickness of the bars
can change based on the data value.
If we're plotting a line chart or
a scatter chart,
we can use different values for the data
points, different glyphs to represent
different values of the data points of yet
a third variable.
Tables, as you're plotting two nominal
values here, two categories, and
looking at the intersection of those
two categories we can plot yet
a third variable based on the shape or
other decorations of the values.
So glyphs are items that indicate data
points in a chart or a data visualization,
and they have other dimensions that
they can use to encode other measures.
So for example,
here is a simulation of a tornado
that's part of a presentation
visualization at the NCSA.
And on the ground we have an array,
basically a grid of cones laid out.
And these cones are glyphs
that are indicating
the ground wind speed and direction.
And so speed is being mapped
to the length of the cone, and
length is a good perceptual
indicator of a quantitative value.
And then we have the direction, the wind
direction is the orientation of the cone.
And ordinarily, we wouldn't care about any
one direction being greater than another,
but we're using the differences in wind
direction from one cone to another
in order to indicate convergence or
divergence of the wind.
And so, we're using perspective here.
So we can see some of the details
of the cones here in the forefront,
and then we can see some
textures in the background.
And then you can see some
color changes in these glyphs.
These cones are being coded in color.
If they're orange,
it represents an updraft, and
if they're in blue, then it's a downdraft.
And so we're using color to emphasize
a directional change in a particularly
important direction of up or down.
And so these glyphs give us
the opportunity to encode additional
data variables in what would ordinarily
be just a two dimensional chart
here on the ground of this
three-dimensional visualization.
So in terms of our analysis
of perceptual effectiveness,
we're mapping quantitative values.
For example, wind speed and
wind direction as length and angle.
And direction as a quantitative value,
because we're looking at the differences
between neighboring points quantitatively.
We have some nominal
values that we're mapping.
For example, updrafts or
downdrafts are being mapped as hue.
We're not saying that one
is greater than the other,
just that they're different categories,
fundamental categories of wind direction,
whether the wind is going up or down.
And we're mapping that to hue,
which is a very effective use of
a mapping value to a data value.
And then finally, the shape is nominal in
the fact that if I go back to the original
slide, the actual particles are being
mapped with spheres and cylinders.
Whereas, the wind speed on the ground
is being mapped with a cone.
And so that shape difference Is another
nominal indication that you're looking at
data from ground wind speed versus
airborne wind speeds from the particles.
So you can map other data too.

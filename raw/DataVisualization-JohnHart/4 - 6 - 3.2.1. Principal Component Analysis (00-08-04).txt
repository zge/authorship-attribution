So principal component analysis
is based on linear algebra,
on eigenvectors and
eigenvalues of matrices.
You don't necessarily have to understand
those details in order to use
Principle component analysis.
If you have a package that will perform
principle component analysis then it will
just convert the data from a high
dimensional form into a low dimensional
form that you can display.
So as we lay out data, and look at ways of
laying out data based on relationships.
It's useful to look at some other
techniques for laying out data.
Even if the data does have variables, or
attributes, or
coordinates associated with it.
So, one of these techniques is
called principal component analysis.
If I have a data set, like this one,
each data value has an x coordinate and
a y coordinate.
But you can really see the main
variance of the data is happening along
this diagonal direction, and
the data isn't varying much
perpendicularly to that direction.
So the x coordinate doesn't
entirely capture the data, and
the y coordinate doesn't entirely
capture the variance of the data.
the variance is actually happening
in a different direction.
So we can look at the variance
of the data as being
the actual dimension where things
are changing along the data.
And it may not be exactly the x
direction or the y direction.
It may be a combination of them.
And as we look at higher dimensional data,
we may find that the data is varying in
some direction, that's a combination of X,
Y, Z,
W...however many dimensions you have.
Principle component analysis helps us find
these directions where the data is varying
a lot.
And also the directions that
the data is varying a little bit.
And then we can reorient it so
that we can just display the dimensions
where the data's varying a lot and
ignore the directions that
the data is varying a little bit.
And then align those dimension
with the displayed dimensions.
So in order to perform principle component
analysis, we have to analyze the data.
First we have to take the data and
then we have to subtract the mean.
So for each of these data items we're
going to add them up, divide by the total
and that'll give us the, by the total
number and then that'll give us the mean.
We subtract that from all the data.
That centers the data about the origin,
and then we're going to compute
this covariance matrix.
So it's a big matrix,
if our data elements are four dimensions,
X, Y, Z and W then the covariance
matrix would be a four by four matrix.
It'll have this many dimensions
by this many dimensions.
And it's just the data items,
after you've subtracted their mean,
multiplied by the other coordinates
of the data items and then averaged.
And that covariance matrix will yield
a symmetric matrix because, for
example, yi times xi is going to
be equal to xi time yi.
And so you can think of a matrix,
a large matrix, as
something that transforms a sphere in high
dimensions into some kind of ellipsoid.
It's going to stretch it
out in a certain direction.
And when you square that matrix,
multiply it times its transpose,
it's going to create a square symmetric
matrix similar to that covariance matrix.
When we pull out the Eigenvectors and
the Eigenvalues of that matrix,
these are directions that, when you
multiply the matrix times that direction,
it's the same thing as just
multiplying it by a scalar value.
So these are directions where if
a matrix is stretching a sphere
into an ellipsoid, so the directions of
the principle axis of that ellipsoid.
And so if you have a lot of variance,
you'll pull out an eigenvector in this
direction that's stretching
the sphere out into a long ellipsoid.
There may be two principal
directions in which case,
that sphere gets stretched
out into this cookie shape.
Principal component analysis finds
those eigenvectors, the direction where
the data is varying the most and
then, it ignores
the small eigenvectors, the directions
where the data is varying the least and
that way we can display the two or
three most varying
directions of data without displaying
all of the dimensions of the data.
So here's an example.
I worked with a group of
people a few years ago.
On a method for computing the geometry
of a scaffolding to support bone
growth in damaged mandibles.
And so we needed some geometry for
a mandible in order to figure out
healthy mandible, and a damaged
mandible to be able to do a subtraction
operation to find this damaged piece.
So if we don't have an undamaged mandible,
how could we find a mandible that
was the shape of the damaged
mandible before the damage happened?
And the way we did this was we scanned
in a bunch of these mandibles and
we specifically measured the shape
of these five data points.
And so we had this big database
of 40 some mandibles, and
each data point,
each of those 40 data points,
was 15-dimensional because each of these
three data points was three-dimensional.
So five three dimensional data
points gave me 15 dimensions.
So I could describe the shape of
a mandible as a 15 dimensional point.
We then perform principal component
analysis to find three main variations.
Three of the directions in
this 15 dimensional space
where these mandibles
were changing the most.
And they were kind of this direction
here that pulls the jaw down,
this direction that causes the jaw
to kind of extrude in the front, and
then a direction that caused
the jaw to move to the side.
And so based on that,
we can plot all of our data points and
this is an example of the mandible, all
the different data sets of our mandibles.
Plotted as a single,
just overlaid on top of each other.
Each one of these corresponds to
a position in this space of mandibles.
And the three dimensions here that
I'm visualizing these mandibles in
corresponds to a direction, a variation
that I found from that principal component
analysis, each of those three dimensions.
So each of these points corresponds to
a point in a 15 dimensional space, but
I'm plotting them in a 3
dimensional space according to
the direction of their highest variance,
as represented by the eigenvector
of that covariance matrix.
And so that performs a form
of dimensionality reduction,
where we can take high dimensional data
and plotted in a low-dimensional space for
visualization by basically focusing on the
dimensions where we're seeing variation
and ignoring the directions where we're
not seeing variation in the data.
So in order to implement multidimensional
scaling, you need to do an optimization.
You don't necessarily have to code
up your own optimization to do that.
For example when I computed
the multidimensional scaling of the cities
in my example, they were computed in Excel
using an optimization package I enabled.
So you don't have to write
an optimization algorithm from scratch.
You can just use an existing
optimization program.

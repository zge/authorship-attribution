[SOUND] So, data visualization can
consist of some very simple charts,
but the success of a data
visualization can often depend on how
we map our data variables to
the elements of those charts.
So we can start with a Bar Chart.
And the bar chart has
two axises typically.
You've got a horizontal axis and
a vertical axis.
And you're usually measuring
discrete values here, and
some either discrete or
continuous value vertically.
And this benefits from the fact
that you're mapping a variable,
a data variable, to both position,
the actual height of these bars,
as well as to a length,
the size of the bar.
And so you do a really good
job of not only seeing.
That, for example, the orange bar
is larger than the blue bar, but
how much larger the orange bar
is to the blue bar because
position and length are both at the top
of perceptual effectiveness for
displaying quantitative values.
And so usually vertically we have some
sort of quantitative dependent variable.
And then horizontally
these can be categories.
And so we have some nominal variable or
at least some discreet variable here
indicating the individual
bars that we're plotting.
And this is an independent variable,
a dimension.
And then this is some kind of
measure of that dimension.
It's a dependant variable depending on
the value of this independent variable.
Similarly, you have a line chart.
A line chart has data points
that are connected by a line.
And so
this is very very similar to a bar chart.
These data points are at the same
altitude as the tops of the bars.
So they benefit from position but
they don't have the length.
That you visually see with
the bars in a bar chart.
So you still do a pretty good job of
being able to discern quantitative values
and their relationship of quantitative
values in the altitudes of these
data points in a line chart.
And so again we have a quantitative
dependent variable vertically that's
changing based on some quantitative
independent variable horizontally.
But now the horizontal value is some
quantitative continuous variable and
the vertical value also needs to be
a quantitative continuous variable
because we're drawing lines between
these data points and these lines imply
that there's a continuity of values
between these data points and
these data points have a horizontal and
a vertical component.
These lines have a horizontal and
vertical component.
So you don't want to use a line chart to
display data across categories because
that's implying that there's in between
values in between these categories and
if they're nominal categories,
if they're discreet,
then there should not
be in between values.
Your visualization shouldn't imply
that there's in between being values.
If we remove the lines,
we get a scatter plot.
And a scatter plot gives
us some other flexibility.
When we display a line plot,
we're displaying a function.
We're displaying some dependent variable
that's changing according
to an independent variable.
So that there's one dependent value for
every independent value.
So there's basically one measure for
each change in dimension.
When we do a scatter plot,
we have two independent variables so
that I can have the same
horizontal value here and
I can have two values associated with
that and so that can be a powerful value.
You usually don't connect these with
a line unless there is some order in
which the data is coming in that you
want to associate with a line and
that would be an additional dimension
you could indicate on a scatter plot.
But the line doesn't infer that
you're plotting a function, because
a scatter plot doesn't plot a function
unless the data's organized that way.
And so you have two independent variables,
a horizontal independent variable and
a vertical independent variable.
And you're getting an indication of
position, both, horizontally and
vertically, for the quantitative
values on each of the two axes.
You also get some cues based on density if
these points tend to cluster in certain
areas.
You can also create a Gantt Chart,
which is kind of looks like a sideways bar
chart, except the bases of objects don't
line up with one of the axises
like they would in a bar chart.
And so in this case,
we have two independent variables,
things that are no longer
related as a function, but
you still get the benefits of position and
length.
Gantt charts are usually
processed diagrams that tell you
the various stages of a project.
And so horizontally a Gantt chart
would usually be some display of time.
This may be a quarter, or
date, or some other time axis.
And then vertically, this is some
categorical, often a discrete or nominal
independent variable here vertically,
and this is typically the tasks.
So you'll have the first tasks and
then the second task, and
the second task may start
before the first task finishes.
And tasks may stop and then start up
again, and so you get this overlap.
Again, it benefits from both position and
length.
but it operates from two
independent variables.
Again one could be quantitative and one
could be nominal similarly to a bar chart.
But in a bar chart you have
one dependent variable
plotted over an independent variable.
In a Gantt chart you have to independent
variables And, finally, you have a table.
In this case, you have two nominal
variables, two categories,
for example,
they're independent variables.
One doesn't depend on
the other necessarily and
you're just looking at two
separate dimensions, and
in plotting some value that would be
the entry in each of these table entries.
So it really benefits from position only,
and again, that position is discrete or
nominal.
It's not a continuous position,
as it would be in a scatter plot.
It's in discrete, quantized regions.
You might also notice if you
look at this long enough,
you can see some flashing
happening at the intersections.
And it's, again, important to
remember your perceptual psychology
to know when you're laying these
things out to pay attention to
contrast to make sure that you don't
get some unwanted perceptual features.
So here's a table that
visualizes the decision
you need to make of what chart
to use in various situations,
depending on the data
that you want to display.
Very often you have at least one
independent variable and then you
may have a dependent variable on it or
you may have an independent variable.
And your independent variable might be
discreet or nominal, some category,
or it might be some some quantity
tha varies continuously and
your dependent value could similarly be
continuous or discrete, or an independent
variable could be a category, or
it could be a continuously changing value.
Independent of your horizontal axis,
and so depending on each
of these configurations you could look
up in this table which you want to use.
If you have an independent variable and
a dependent variable, then most
often you want to use a bar chart.
You can use a line chart, but only when
you have a continuous dependent variable
and a continuous independent variable,
because the lines indicate
that they're in between values
both horizontally and vertically.
You want to use a Gantt chart if
you have a independent variable.
That's continuous and
a categorical axis vertically or
a categorical axis horizontally and
a continuous value vertically.
Either one of those will
form a Gantt chart.
If you have two categorical axes,
you want to make a table.
And if you have two continuous
axes that are both independent,
you want to make a scatter plot.
So we use the kind of data that
we're trying to visualize nominal,
ordered, quantitative,
whether it's continuous,
whether it's discreet, whether
variables are dependent or independent.
To not only figure out how they
map to chart elements, but
more importantly to decide
which chart best displays them.

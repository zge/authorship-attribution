So when we go to visualize data using
three-dimensional computer graphics,
we find that photorealism isn't
always the best choice, and
sometimes we need alternative methods for
depicting three-dimensional scenes.
If we can photograph or
render with computer graphics everything,
then why do we need things
like illustrations?
And the answer is that illustrations
can more clearly depict
a three-dimensional configuration
than a photograph can.
And so then the question is how can we use
three-dimensional computer graphics to
render an illustration?
So a good example of this
form of non-photorealistic
rendering is Gray's Anatomy.
And here's an illustration of
the human heart from Gray's Anatomy,
and it's not a photograph.
A photograph would be gory and
covered with blood and
it would be hard to see all
of these configurations.
But with an illustration the artist has
much more control over the lighting and
the texturing and
the cut-aways, in order to more clearly
denote the structures of the heart.
What we'd like to do is be able to do
the same thing with data visualization.
So for example,
if I have a simple model of a pig,
I could render it using
photorealistic illumination and
inclusion and
fills to get this shape here.
But I could also use non-photorealistic
techniques to get a more cartoony
version of this pig that conveys
much the same information.
And you'll notice that this pig has
outline strokes and it has fills.
And so the outline strokes
are created from contours.
And for a three-dimensional scene,
the way we get those contours is by
tracing them to create things
like silhouette curves,
the border between the shape and
the background.
And sometimes this boundary will cover
itself and other contours of the shading.
And so sometimes these contours will
trace behind other surfaces and
so we still need to respect occlusion, so
we have to trim away portions of the
contour that are hidden by other regions.
But that leaves us with a set
of outlines and a set of regions
that we can then render using some
of our vector graphics techniques
instead of some of our three-dimensional
photorealistic techniques.
So when we fill in the surfaces we may
not want to use photorealistic lighting.
This top line shows a bunch of spheres
rendered with photorealistic lighting, and
you can see that in each case we have
a diffuse color illumination and
then a white specular highlight.
So we're getting diffuse illumination and
specular illumination.
The light source is to the up and
right of the object.
And yet we don't see any information
in the dark side of the moon here,
the dark side of the sphere.
That's because this is shadowed
because of photorealistic lighting.
You're not going to see any
information in the shadows.
You can still see the color of the object
because there's enough ambient light
bouncing around to get the color, but
you don't see any orientation information.
This very well could be
a disk instead of the sphere.
We know it's a sphere because of
the illuminated side, and so we can create
better illumination of the sphere
using non-photorealistic illumination.
In this case replacing the diffuse
illumination here with
a non-photorealistic diffuse illumination
that we get by taking the color map,
in this case going from red to black, and
then mixing it with a cool-to-warm,
in this case blue-to-yellow, color map.
And that creates a gradation that
goes from a cool form of red, kind of
a bluer shade of red, all the way to
a warmer shade of red, kind of an orange.
So we're going from a violet to an orange.
And then we can apply that to the entire
sphere based on the orientation of
the surface and the light source, and then
we get more information on the shadowed
side of the object in addition to
the illuminated side of the object.
And these shapes look even more spherical
than they do in the physical case.
So when we're displaying three-dimensional
shapes, in this case skeletal shapes,
with photorealistic illumination you're
not seeing anything in the dark sides of
these objects because of the nature
of shadows and illumination.
But when we apply non-photorealistic
illumination we can see these contours,
these divots in the bone that are revealed
by this non-photorealistic shading,
that are also hidden in
photorealistic shading.
In both cases we've also added
the contour to better indicate
the outlines of these shapes.
Here's another example.
This is a photorealistic
rendering of a part and
this is a non-photorealistic
rendering of a part.
You're missing all of
the shape information of
the orientation of the surface
on the shadowed side, and
we gain that with our
non-photorealistic shading.
And also the contours help
us see the configuration and
the definite occlusion of
the individual pieces.
So what did we learn?
We learned that photorealistic
rendering is based on physics,
whereas non-photorealistic rendering is
based on the psychology of perception.
For non-photorealistic rendering
we're pulling out the contours and
filling them in instead of necessarily
focusing on the surface itself.
And non-photorealistic rendering,
in general,
makes it easier to communicate shape and
the depiction of an object without being
burdened with the physical reality
of what the object would look like.

>> So
in Module 4 we're going to
look at visualization systems.
In Module 2 we learned how to plot data
using coordinates stored in the data.
In Module 3 we learned how to plot data
using coordinates that we had
to compute based on the data.
In Module 4 we're going to focus on
systems that allow the user to decide how
they want to plot the data,
what data to plot.
It's going to focus on the connection
of the user to the data and
a visualization system that helps figure
out the best way to plot that data.

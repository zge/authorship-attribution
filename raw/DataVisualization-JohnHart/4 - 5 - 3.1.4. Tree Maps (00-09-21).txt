So when we want to visualize
hierarchical relationships,
there's a particularly good method for
doing that called a tree map.
So as we visualize graphs, and graphs
represent relations between data items.
One relation that we'll want to visualize
often is hierarchical relationships,
things like parents and
child relationships, ancestry and
descendant relationships.
And so
in an undirected graph if you have a tree,
any of these nodes could
serve as the root.
But often in layouts we
can identify a root node.
And we can look at ancestry and
descendants relationships
based on that root node based on the edge
distance from a node to that root node.
In a directed graph, we can set up
a more definitive parent child
relationship using a directed edge.
And we can have child nodes
point towards parent nodes,
or the other way around
if we set it up that way.
We can specify a root
node that has no parent,
in this directed edge representation.
And we can create hierarchies where
a node could have multiple parents, where
we could make them an actual tree, in
which case each node has a single parent.
And then we can also
speak of a tree depth,
which is basically the number of parents a
node has at the bottom level of the tree.
Or the number of descendants, the maximum
number of descendants a root node would
have along one chain of these edges.
And so
we often need to visualize these trees.
This is an example from genetics of fish,
and
the nodes in this case
are laid out radially.
And then the tree structure
is shown on the inside.
Here's another example
from the Tree of Life.
And you can go to this website and
zoom in on this image and
see a lot more detail than is shown here.
But this is a layout that shows
a hierarchical relationship as well.
One of the methods for
displaying hierarchical relationships
that I've found quite useful is treemaps.
Treemaps were introduced by
Ben Schneiderman in 1992.
And, they map hierarchical organizations
of quantities into areas, so
it's a very visual method for displaying
hierarchies based on subset operations.
And so, we have an example of this
in a utility called WinDirStat,
which displays a Windows file system.
And it represents the entire
file system by this rectangle.
And then that root directory is
subdivided into smaller rectangles
representing sub-directories.
And each smaller rectangle is subdivided
into smaller rectangles which
are sub-directories of that subdirectory.
All the way down to individual rectangles,
where each of these individual
rectangles represents a single file.
And so it gives you this nice broad
overview of your file system, but
it also shows you how the file system is
divvied up into individual directories and
sub-directories and files.
And so it's a good indication of
quantitative views, in this case,
of disk space.
It's telling me how my files and
subdirectories are taking up
different amounts of disk space.
And so it's mapping disk space to area.
And I can get a pretty good
quantitative measure of that
disk space based on the area relationship
of each of these sub-rectangles.
So how do we compute a tree map?
Well, if you're given some hierarchy,
some tree.
And for a tree map, it has to be a tree.
It can't just be a regular hierarchy.
Each node has to have a single parent.
You have some value,
usually at the bottom level.
For that previous example,
this would be the disk space
taken up by each individual file.
And so we first need to do a bottom up
procedure that takes our tree nodes, and
for the parent nodes of our tree,
adds up the child nodes in
order to assign them a value.
So now each of the parent nodes is
equal to the sum of its child nodes.
This parent is equal to 4.
It's 1 plus 2 plus 1.
This parent is equal to 11,
because it's 4 plus 4 plus 3.
And finally 16, which is the sum
of all of these adds up to 16.
And then we're going to use that
parent-child relationship and
the values that it represents in order
to subdivide some rectangular region.
In order to display how these small
quantities at the bottom are organized,
as portions of this full 16 value
at the top, at the root node.
And so the first thing we do is we need
to subdivide our rectangle into portions
representing the first set of descendants,
11 and 5.
And so we subdivide the rectangle into
a portion that is eleven sixteenths and
five sixteenths.
And so, we subdivide it horizontally
with a single vertical division
at eleven-sixteenths of the way
from this edge to this edge.
Into a portion that's
eleven-sixteenths and five-sixteenths.
Now we have two portions,
and these portions are actually
taller than they are wide.
So we're going to subdivide them
vertically instead of horizontally for
the next step.
So now we've got this portion
here on the left representing 11.
We need to subdivide that into
portions representing 4, 4, and 3.
So we subdivide them into a portion
that's four-elevenths along the way,
another four-elevenths along the way,
and then finally another
three-elevenths along the way,
representing each of these three nodes.
And now these are wider
than they are tall, so
we're going to subdivide them horizontally
instead of vertically at the next step.
And so we do this again, and we
subdivide this top node into one-fourth,
two-fourth, and
one-fourth portions horizontally.
We do this with all the rest of the nodes,
and we get this tree map of
all of the nodes we see here.
And so here I've got 1, 2, 1.
One-fourth, one-half, one-fourth of
this rectangle representing four units.
I've got 1, 1, and
2 of this rectangle representing 4 units,
and then 2 and
1 of this rectangle representing 3 units.
All together, those represent 11 units.
And on this side, these 5 units,
that were five-sixteenths
of the entire triangle are being
represented by 3 and 2.
And I've got a slightly thicker line
here differentiating between them.
And then this 3 unit is
by individual units here,
and this 2 unit is by
individual units here.
And so, we're using area and
a hierarchy of area into finer and
finer rectangles in order to divvy up this
large rectangle into its component pieces.
You'll notice that for example,
this rectangle here is
eleven forty-eighths wide
because it's one-third
of eleven-sixteenths.
It's one-third of the eleven-sixteenths
on this side of this thick black line.
So one-third times eleven-sixteenths
is eleven forty-eighths.
This bottom, the height of this
is equal to three-elevenths.
It was three-elevenths of this whole unit.
And so we have three-elevenths times
eleven forty-eighths is equal to
one-sixteenth, which is exactly
the portion one-sixteenth.
Where is it?
Right here, one-sixteenth of the entire
area that we wanted to represent.
And so that gives you a good
visual connection between the area
of this tree map layout as
a portion of the whole.
And the organization of this
node representing one unit of
this root node representing 16 units.
Can also see some of the difficulty in
doing ordinal connections between area.
This is 2 units of area, and
this is 2 units of area.
If I didn't have these numbers here,
it may not be as easy to see that this
rectangle is the same area as
this more square region is.
So area's not that good at
representing ordinal amounts.
But it is a pretty good tool for
representing quantities in general.
So the tree map is a good method for
visualizing hierarchies because it relates
the region of that hierarchy to a region
on the screen, associating it with area.
That is,
we've seen area can be a decent but
not great method for
ordinal relationships.

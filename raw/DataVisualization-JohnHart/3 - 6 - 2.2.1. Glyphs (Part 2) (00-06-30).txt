So, in a bar chart for example, we can
use glyphs to represent more than just
the actual value of data elements, we can
use glyphs to represent their variants.
So in this case if we have bars,
we can put a glyph at the top of each bar
indicating the value, but
we can also add information, for
example, standard deviation or variants.
And, in fact, where the mean or
median value is indicated and
where the data varies, so
these could be 25%, 75% bars.
And we can see in some cases that
the distribution of data that gets
aggregated and
represented as a single bar,
the actual distribution is skewed
in one direction or another.
In tables, you can use glyphs,
you can represent entries as, for
example, colors, and that's a kind
of a glyph, a very simple glyph.
But mapping table values to color
is a very common thing, and
we're all used to this and seeing weather
maps where heat is mapped to color,
as for example, this example here.
Quantitatively mapping
color is not necessarily
the most effective way for
perceptual accuracy.
We can tell that it's colder up here and
warmer down here,
we just might not be able to tell how much
colder or how much warmer it is unless
we go to the reference here, and
try to make an equivalence on this
legend here showing what the average
temperature is for this particular month.
And you can do this discretely as well.
This is an example of
continuous variables.
You can do this discretely, and we do
this in computer science all the time.
If I have a program that I'm trying to
optimize, I might change one parameter
some discrete number of times,
and some other parameter some
discrete number of times, and try to find
the sweet spot in terms of performance.
The lowest performance here
I'm displaying in red,
233 is the optimal value here,
and I can see which parameter of
values are giving me worse results.
And these things may
jump around quite a bit.
Programs tend to behave non-linearly
as you change these parameters
because the systems they run
on are quite complicated.
But having these glyphs, basically these
numbers represented as color as well,
helps you hone in on the good values.
And this one was enabled
just using Microsoft Excel.
The conditional formatting
option allows you to
represent values with color as well.
So you can also use glyphs to do
high dimensional visualization.
So in this case this is
worlds within worlds,
I've set up horizontal and
vertical nominal,
categorical axes and
when I'm plotting inside
each of these table cells,
is a separate plot, it's a scatter plot.
I just happen to have one data
point in the scatter plot, so
I've embedded a two dimensional plot in
each element of a two dimensional table.
So that enables you to look
at four dimensional data
as basically a two dimensional
table of two-dimensional plots.
In this case what I'm doing is I've
got a two-dimensional table of glyphs.
Each glyph happens to be
a two-dimensional plot.
And so I'm looking in this
case at life expectancy, and
I'm looking at the rates of infant
mortality inside each year from 2000,
2001, 2002, 2003, 2004.
And then vertically I'm looking at
the various continents or regions, and
I'm looking at the life expectancy
measured inside each one of those.
So I've got an outer table
that's looking at the year and
vertically looking at
the region of the world, and
then inside each year and
each region of the world,
I'm plotting infant mortality
versus life expectancy.
You can see some shifts in the data as we
move across different areas of the world.
And you can see some shifts
in infant mortality, but
you can see that there aren't as many
shifts as you move from year to year.
There's another interesting glyph that
you can use called Chernoff faces, and
in this case you're creating a table,
some other layout, but
the data points are being plotted with
faces, and the attributes of the face
are indicating various measures of
some dimension of the data set.
In this case this is 12 state judges as
rated by lawyers and you can map
certain features, certain aspects,
of the way the state judges were being
measured, for example, the number of
times they were overturned, might change
the expression from happy to sad.
And the size of the face may be
the number of cases they've seen.
So, you know, this face may look
quite large, and this face look
quite small because this state judge has
reviewed more cases than has this judge.
And so you can't make value judgments
based on the appearance of the faces, but
the appearance of the faces and
the expressions that they
have can give you another data channel
that you can perceive and remember,
actually quite well as a way of finding
interesting aspects of the data,
things in the data that stand out.
So we learned that we can use glyphs
to display many other attributes
of our data when we're using a chart or
some other data visualization.

So when we visualize data
organized as a graph,
we'll likely want to
lay it out in a plane.
There's a kind of graph that
enables that called a planar graph.
So as we saw before we're going to
represent data items as nodes and
edges between nodes will represent
relationships between those data items.
In some cases we'll have a graph,
a planar graph for example.
A planar graph can be drawn such that the
edges connecting the nodes don't cross.
That's called a planar embedding.
The same planar graph,
in this case you've got the same foreign
nodes connected by the same five edges.
In this non planar
embedding the edges cross.
And so, the same graph,
they're both planar graphs.
What we'd like to do is be
able to find the embedding,
the way to lay out the nodes so
that the edges don't cross, so
it'll be clearer to the observer,
the relationship between the nodes.
So we can do this.
We can do this for very large graphs.
For example, here's a triangle mesh
representing a geometric object.
It's a triangle mesh, so
the vertices are nodes and
the edges of the triangles form
the edges between the nodes.
This graph, this large graph of
50,000 nodes is not a planar graph,
but if I make cuts in it, if I separate
the faces and duplicate edges,
I can turn it into a planar graph just by
making these cuts along the black lines.
And as a planar graph, I can then find
a way of embedding it into the plane so
that the edges don't cross.
There's so many nodes and so
many edges in this this graph and
it's hard to see all of the edges,
so trust me that they don't cross.
Hopefully you'll be working
with fewer nodes and edges so
that your layouts will be
a little more clear than this.
So there's a way we can find these
embeddings automatically, and
it's called Tutte's Method, and it
starts by picking some of your nodes and
defining where they
should be in the layout.
So in this case, I'm going to use eight
nodes, 12 edges that make a cube,
and I'm going to take
these first four nodes,
and I'm going to find positions for
them in for example an SVG Canvass.
I'm going to position node 1 at (0,0),
node 2 at (1,0),
node 3 at (0,1), and node 4 at node (1,1).
And then I'm going to try to figure out
where do I want to position nodes 5, 6, 7,
and 8, in order to make a plainer
embedding of this graph.
This graph is shown in
a non planar embedding,
because we've got edge crossings.
We want to find out how to
make a planar embedding of it.
So in order to do this automatically for
any graph,
we're going to need to
solve a linear system.
So we'll create a matrix.
In fact, an adjacency matrix,
a special kind of adjacency
matrix called a Laplacian matrix.
So it's an adjacency matrix which means,
I'm going to take one node to another node
in case of node 1 is connected to node 2,
so in row one, column two,
I'm going to have a non zero entry.
In this case, the non zero entry
is going to be 1 over the degree.
The node one has degree three,
it has three edges extending from it,
so I'll put a one-third there.
And so node 1 is connected to nodes 2,
3, and 5,
and so I'll put one-third in columns two,
three, and
five, and node one isn't
connected to the other nodes.
So in those columns including node one,
in those columns I'll put a zero.
The nice thing about the Laplacian
form of an adjacency
matrix is the for
node 1 I'm connected to three items.
My degree is three.
The value I'm putting in
is one over the degree.
So if I add all of the elements up for
row one I get one.
So no we're going to create a special
matrix from that Laplacian adjacency
matrix.
We'll just call this matrix A.
First thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to take that Laplace matrix, and
I'm going to zero out all of the rows for
the nodes I've already assigned.
So I've already assigned Node 1,
2, 3, and 4 a position.
So I'll just zero those out
in my adjacency matrix,
subtract the whole thing
from the identity matrix.
The identity matrix just has ones down
the diagonal and zeros everyplace else.
That will give me this matrix
A that I'm going to solve
in order to find the placements for
nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
So I need to set up a linear system,
and so
we'll set up a linear system for
the x coordinates of our nodes, and
then we'll set up a separate linear
system for the y coordinates.
So the linear system we use for
the x coordinates looks like this.
It's my matrix A, and
then I've got times x,
a column vector that's just the x
coordinates of my nodes, and
then finally I've got the answer, what
the x coordinates actually should be in
the case of the first four nodes and
then zeros for the nodes I want to solve.
So this is saying that one times x one,
the x coordinate of node one,
one time x one and
zero times everything else equals zero.
Because that what I've assigned.
So here I've got node 0,
node 1, nodes 2 and node 3,
these are the x coordinates of node 1,
2, 3, and 4.
And so here I've got one, this second row.
1 times x2 is equal to 1, and the x
coordinate of a sine for node two is one.
So that's what I put
in these first entries
of this bx column vector, and
the remaining entries are just zero.
The nice thing here is that
if we look at row five,
row five says that the x
coordinate of node 5, x5,
one times x5 minus one-third times x1,
minus one-third times x6,
minus one-third times x7,
is going to be equal to zero.
That's basically setting
up a linear equation so
that wherever I position nodes 6 and
7, they're going to impact node 5.
Once we do that for rows five, six, seven,
and eight corresponding to nodes 5,
6, 7, and 8, and when we solve this
system we'll have positions for
nodes 5, 6, 7, and
8 that solve that relationship.
Do the same thing for the y coordinates.
So now my by column vector is equal
to the y coordinates for nodes 1, 2,
3 and 4 that I've placed, and
then add zeroes for everything else.
Node 1 has zero for the y coordinate.
Node 2 has zero for the y coordinate.
Node 3 has one for the y coordinate, and
node 4 has one for the y coordinate,
and this is basically saying that y1 = 0,
y2 = 0, y3 = 1, y4 = 1.
But it's saying that the y coordinate for
node 5 is equal to whatever the y
coordinate is for node 5, minus one-third,
times the y coordinate for node 1, minus
one-third the y coordinate for node 6,
and minus one-third the y coordinate for
node 7, and so on for the remaining nodes.
So I've basically setup these
equations for the x system.
I said x1 is equal to zero, x2 is
equal to one, x3 is equal to zero, and
x4 is equal to one.
And then I've set up these equations for
the x coordinates of the remaining.
I've set up similar equations for
the y coordinate.
So if I group these together,
I basically position x1 and
y1 at the xy coordinates for
node 1 at (0, 0), node 2 at (1,
0), node 3 at (0, 1),
node 4 at (1, 1), and
I've set up these relationships for
remaining coordinates.
Now, you might notice something here.
I'm basically saying that node 5
It's going to be node 1's position
plus node 6 position plus node
7 position divided by three.
So basically the position of each node is
going to be the average of the position
of its neighboring nodes that it shares
an edge with, and that's true for
all the remaining nodes.
And so we fix the position,
we set the position for
some of our nodes and
then the remaining are just
going to be set to be the average
of the nodes that are connected to.
And so if I solve that system, if I
solve that linear system you can use any
numerical methods you like to solve that
matrix problem, you get the solution.
So that node 5 is at (1/3, 1/3).
Node 6 is at (2/3, 1/3).
Node 7 is at (1/3, 2/3), and
node 8 is at (2/3, 2/3).
And so each of these nodes ends up being
at the average, the position of node five
is equal to the average, the centroid
of node one, node six, and node seven.
So I take node 1 plus the position of
node 6 plus the position of node 7,
divide by three, and I get node 5.
So we've solved for
these positions of node 5, 6, 7, and
8 to find this planar layout of this
graph shown here in a non planar
embedding by solving a matrix problem.
You don't have to solve a matrix
necessarily to do this.
You can do the same thing by basically
starting with your nodes 1, 2,
3, 4 in their fixed position, and
then for all the remaining nodes,
you can assign them random positions
to begin with and then iteratively,
replace those node positions with
the average of their neighboring nodes.
And if you continually
replace every node's position
with the average of it's
neighboring node's position,
those nodes'll work into
place where they belong.
And so you can solve this system
without setting up a matrix
just by constantly doing
that iterative procedure
of moving every node to the average
of it's neighboring nodes.
So Tutte's method tells us that we can
solve a linear system to embed a planar
graph, but it's not that difficult.
You can do the exact same
thing by nailing down
a few of your nodes into fixed positions.
And then the rest of the nodes,
you just replace their position with
average of their neighbor's positions,
the positions of the neighbors
that share an edge with that node.
If you keep doing that over and over,
those nodes will relax into the exact same
position that tutte's
method will converge to.

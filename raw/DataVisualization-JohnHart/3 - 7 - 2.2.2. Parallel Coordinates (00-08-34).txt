So
we're used to seeing
two-dimensional images, and
we can use two-dimensional images to
perceive our three-dimensional world, and
we perceive time as maybe
a fourth dimension, but
then our ability to perceive dimensions is
limited to those three or four dimensions.
Parallel coordinates offer us a way
of plotting even higher dimensional
spaces than that.
So in looking at the higher
dimensional drawings or
higher dimensional spaces,
you can think of something like a square.
A square consists of two
one-dimensional lines,
these two vertical lines,
that are separated horizontally.
I've taken a one dimensional line,
copied into a second vertical line and
then connected them up with
lines between the vertices.
So I've now got a two-dimensional square.
If I want to make this two-dimensional
square into a three-dimensional cube,
I just copy the square, and move it in
a direction, and then I just link up
the corresponding vertices with lines, and
that gives me a three-dimensional cube.
If I want a four-dimensional cube,
I just take the three-dimensional cube and
I make another copy of it and
offset it in another direction, and
then just draw lines between
the corresponding vertices and it gives me
a tesseract, some two-dimensional
projection of a four-dimensional cube.
And so you can do this, but
it's not very helpful for
visualization, because you've got all
these different directions that are being
projected into a two-dimensional image,
and after three dimensions, we're just
not used to perceiving the world in four
or higher dimensions, and so we just have
difficulty perceiving four-dimensional or
higher data being projected that way.
If I have a scatter plot, for example,
I can pretty readily see x and
y encoded in the positional Cartesian
coordinates of x and y here.
If I had a z coordinate
that's being projected,
z is being foreshortened as
it's being projected here, and
I've gotta mentally remember that z
is some combination of horizontal and
vertical that's different than
the horizontal x or the vertical y axis.
So you can draw these hints that
are basically similar to a shadow,
where I'm indicating,
with these dashed lines,
what the coordinates of this green
dot are in three dimensions,
because it lacks other visual cues
of where it is in three dimensions.
If you try to do this in four dimensions,
then it becomes a nightmare to
manage all those dimensions.
So there's a better technique for doing
this called parallel coordinates that
Al Inselberg demonstrated to
me back in the early 90s,
when they were first invented, and I was
quite blown away by his demonstration, and
I'll try to reproduce it here.
So on parallel coordinates, we're
going to take the Cartesian coordinates.
We have a horizontal x-axis and
a vertical y-axis, and
we're going to take these axes and
we're going to
make them parallel instead of orthogonal,
at right angles, as they usually are.
So I'm going to take the x-axis,
I'm going to put it here, and
I'm going to take the y-axis and
I'm going to put it here.
And so I'll label this axis x and
this axis y.
So now the two axes are not orthogonal.
They're parallel to each other and
they don't extend from the same origin.
So the origin here is
horizontally at the bottom and
increasing x goes up this axis,
increasing y goes up this axis.
So now I've got the data points, and I
need to figure out where these data points
occur, so if I take the y-coordinates
of each data point,
I can map each point onto its
corresponding position on the y-axis.
I'm just basically dragging them across
horizontally, because their position in y
in this chart corresponds to
their height along this y-axis.
If I want to do the same for
the x-axis, I'm going to basically take
the x position of each point, and then I'm
going to drag it to the corresponding
x position on this vertical x-axis, so
the horizontal length here corresponds
to the vertical length here, and
so blue and red are at the same
horizontal x coordinate, and so
they overlap each other on the x-axis.
And in green is a little bit
farther to the right, so
it's going to be a little bit
higher on the parallel x-axis.
Yellow is a little bit
farther to the right so
it's going to be a little bit higher.
And then this blue green color
dot is the farthest right so
it'll be the highest on the x-axis.
So now I've got this one set of
points that's now appearing as two
sets of points, and
I've got a correspondence between color,
and color's a good perceptual
indicator of category, but
it's very difficult to
perceive what's going on here.
So what we're going to do is, instead of
displaying these as points on the axis,
I'm going to connect these
points with lines, and
I'm going to delete the original points,
and
now we get this nice duality between
points in the coordinate system,
here, and
lines in the coordinate system, here.
So, this orange point, here,
has an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate.
It corresponds to this line connecting
its x-coordinate to its y-coordinate.
And so each one of these five points
in the Cartesian x y coordinate
system corresponds to a line in
the parallel x y coordinate system here.
Some other features are collinearity,
so if these three points lie along
the same line, then you get this nice
convergence in parallel coordinates.
And so you can see some co-linearity
that happens, because lines in parallel
coordinates, corresponding to points in
Cartesian coordinates that are collinear,
will basically converge in a point
in the parallel coordinate system.
So you can add extra dimensions.
If I add a z-axis here, I'd have to add
all sorts of three-dimensional queues to
these data points to figure out
where they are in three dimensions.
In parallel coordinates,
I just add a z-axis here.
And then I can connect
the z-coordinates to the y-coordinates,
and follow this line from its x-coordinate
to its y-coordinate to its z-coordinate.
And if I add a fourth w-axis.
It's actually easy to
add a fourth axis here.
And in fact, all of these points may be
collinear in the z w coordinate system,
and you can see because these lines
are kind of converging to the same point.
The point that they converge to doesn't
necessarily have to be between the axes.
But there are some ways of helping
a person to see these points.
And so these parallel coordinates are
really useful for high-dimensional data.
And you get this correspondence of being
able to follow these lines through
the various coordinates and
have them correspond to points here, and
it's easier to see some relationships.
There could be correspondences
between the w-axis and the y-axis, and
we wouldn't see those unless we
also had lines from these points on
the w-axis to the points on the y-axis,
and so you get a bit of a combinatorial
nightmare when you try to connect
every axis to every other axis.
So there's some decision making that
needs to happen if you're going to show
correspondences between axes,
to choose to have those axes next to each
other in the parallel coordinates system.
So parallel coordinates take
the orthogonal axes of the Cartesian
coordinate system and they lay them out in
parallel, and you can have any number of
these parallel coordinate axes laid
next to each other, and you can start to
perceive higher dimensional data
using these parallel coordinates.
Some of the problems of parallel
coordinates are the fact that you're only
seeing the pairwise relationship between
the axes, but they can be very useful for
finding certain features in your data,
for example, collinearity.

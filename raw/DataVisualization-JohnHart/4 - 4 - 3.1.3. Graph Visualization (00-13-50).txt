So for handling non-coordinate data,
non-numerical data, we're often more
interested in the relationship between
data items than in
the data items themselves.
And so we'll use a graph or
a network to represent
the relationships between data items.
And so we'll talk here about different
ways of specifying a graph and
different attributes of graphs, and how
graphs are represented computationally.
So a graph just consists of nodes and
edges.
In this case we have four nodes and
we have five edges connecting these nodes.
And so
the nodes will represent a data item and
the edge will represent
a relationship between two data items.
If we add this particular edge,
then every data item is going to be
connected to every other data item.
We could call that a complete graph,
or a clique of these four nodes.
Here on the left I've got I've got
a graph of four nodes connected by
five edges, and on the right I've got
four nodes connected by five edges.
In fact, these two graphs are isomorphic,
they're the same graph,
they're just laid out differently.
And on the right I've got a planar graph,
which means that the nodes and
edges are laid out so
that none of the edges cross each other.
And then I can speak of a face as being
the region bounded by a cycle of edges,
starting and ending at the same node.
And also we can think of,
we would say that these are two
different embeddings of the same graph.
Or at least these graphs are isomorphic.
If we think of this whole arrangement of
eight nodes and ten edges as a single
graph, then that would be one graph
consisting of two connected components.
But the entire graph containing
both of these subgraphs would
be a disconnected graph.
We can also have directed graphs.
So in an ordinary graph,
or an undirected graph,
just has edges but does not really
suggest the direction of these edges.
We can have a directed graph by using
arrows to indicate a direction, so
that we would have a connection
from this node to this node, but
not necessarily a connection from
this node back to this node.
And you can think of a graph as having
a cycle, a directed graph having a cycle.
So, this undirected graph, this ordinary
graph has a cycle because these three
nodes, I can start at this node, and
I can follow this cycle to get back.
You can have a cyclic, directed graph
because I can follow the cycle here.
This graph is acyclic
because there is no cycle.
Once I get to this node,
I can go to this node.
Once I get this node,
I can't go any place further.
So, there's no way to get
back to any of these nodes
by following these edges in
the directions indicated.
You can also have trees in a graph
that's connected that has one less edge
than the number of nodes, forms a tree.
It's minimally connected.
And you can think of having a parent
node but for an undirected graph,
any of these nodes could be the parent and
you could think of multiple siblings.
Here's some graphs with
many more edges and
you can see kind of the way they're
laid out would imply a parent.
But I could lay these out
in isomorphic methods,
equivalent methods and another node
might appear to be the parent.
When you have directed graphs,
the tree forms a hierarchy and
then you can have a parent.
So in this case, these child nodes
point to their parents, and so
I've plotted their parents higher than the
child nodes, and then there's a clear root
node, this one parent that's
the parent of all of these nodes.
You can also have a hierarchy
that's not a tree.
In this case we have a parent
relationship, but this child node
has two parents, and so
you've a definite hierarchy here, but
it's not a tree because a tree,
each node would have a single parent node.
There's also a relationship between
the number of edges each node has and
the kind of graph you're looking at.
We talked about the degree of
the node as being the number of edges
extending from a node.
Directed graphs would have a different
in-degree than an out-degree.
The in-degree would be the number
of edges going into the node and
the out degree would be the number
of edges leaving the node.
And then the number of nodes
you have of each degree,
if it follows this kind of fall-off,
it's called a social network.
A social network you can think of
this as a friends' network, or
many natural
data relationships follow this power law,
this social network power law.
In this case, this is the number
of interactions of yeast proteins.
Each one of these nodes
is a yeast protein.
And the edges represent interactions
between yeast proteins.
And in this case, you have many nodes
that have a few interactions that
are connected to one or two,
you have one or two edges.
And then you have many fewer nodes that
have high degree, they have a lot of edges
that are connected to a lot of
other nodes by a single edge.
And so in this case, the number of
nodes that have a certain degree
follows a power law.
If the y is the number of nodes with
that degree is equal to the degree
to some power with some
constant multiplied to it.
And you see this fall-off
happen quite often.
These graphs tend not to be planer.
They tend to be difficult to embed.
They also tend to be the most popular
graphs that we encounter in real life.
Finally we're going to use an adjacency
matrix to represent graphs.
And so, in this case we have
a graph that has four nodes,
four data items, one,
two, three, and four.
And then we're going to represent
this graph using this matrix.
In this case, the adjacency
matrix will have a 1 in row one,
column two if there's an edge
connecting node one to node two.
Likewise, it'll have a 1 in row two,
column one because it connects
node two to node one.
And so it'll be symmetric because
this is a non-directed graph.
If it was a directed graph, if it was
directed from node one to node two
by an edge leaving node one going to node
two, then you would have a 1 in row one,
column two, but
you would have a 0 in row two, column one.
So a directed graph could have
an asymmetric adjacency matrix, but
an ordinary graph, a non-directed graph,
we just have a symmetric adjacency matrix.
And these edges could also have weights,
in which case you might not just have 0 or
1, you might have a value here
to indicate how strong
the connection is between nodes.
And the diagonal is usually 0 unless
there's some relationship between the node
and itself, and
you can represent that along the diagonal.
So, it might be good to review graphs and
the different kinds of graphs,
the different representations of graphs,
and the different attributes of graphs,
to familiarize yourself with them
because we'll be using those for
the rest of this module.

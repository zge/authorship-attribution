So
now we'll discuss three dimensional
graphics for visualization.
And in order to do three
dimensional graphics,
we have to simulate how light
gets from a light source.
Off of an object into our eyes so
that we can perceive it,
the same way that we would
perceive a real world scene.
So what will we learn?
We'll learn about the real world ways
that light leaves a light source and
reaches our eye.
We'll learn the physics of why is
the sky blue, why is the sun yellow,
why is grass green, and in general,
how does three-dimensional graphics
simulate these physical processes?
And so here's a typical scene of the real
world and how we would perceive that.
We have a light source, an object
reflecting light and then a sensor,
which is our eye.
And light leaves,
in this case, the sun, and
this light is powerful across the
spectrum, and so it's essentially white.
But then that light goes to the sky.
And the sky scatters the light
differently based on which region of
the spectrum it's dealing with.
So, light at the red wavelengths
will get scattered less and
light at the blue wavelengths
will get scattered more.
So that light gets scattered
to other locations in the sky,
which makes the sky blue.
And which makes the sun
appear yellow because
that light is making it
all the way through.
That yellow sunlight hits a tree or
grass or any other biome and
certain wavelengths of that
light are getting absorbed
by chlorophyll molecules and turned
into photosynthate which feeds the tree.
And so the chlorophyll is absorbing
light mostly in the blue regions,
the blue wavelengths and then the red
wavelengths and reflecting light.
Not absorbing the light
in the green wavelengths.
So the light reflected off
of a tree is mostly green.
And so then it reaches, it hits us in
the eye, reaches our censor in our eye,
so that we can perceive it.
And there it gets sensed
by essentially cones,
the colors, the wavelengths of light
stimulate three different kinds of cones.
A mostly red cone, a mostly green cone and
a mostly blue cone.
And these send three different
responses to our perceptual system.
And so, you may have a complex wavelength
of light indicating it's color,
but at some point when
the eye perceives that,
that gets turned into three numbers
instead of a bunch of numbers.
And so we get this tristimulus
theory of light perception.
And that's why we display
things using red, green,
blue colors in pixels
on graphics displays,
to directly stimulate the red cones,
the green cones and the blue cones.
So, we can simulate this process, and
we can look, for example, at a camera.
And, a modern camera.
In this case, a pinhole camera
that has a very small aperture
is getting light reflected
off of an object.
In this case, this blue bunny rabbit.
That goes through a focal point and
it gets projected onto an image plane
that would be sensed in modern
cameras by a CCD array.
We can take that image plane and we can
just bring that in front of the camera and
we get the exact same image.
It's not inverted.
It's just placed in front.
And you can think of this
as being a window and
you're looking through a window out
into the world and seeing a blue bunny.
You can imagine where that blue
bunny would be there in the window
that you see there and that's
the exact same image inverted that you
would get on the film plane, because
of the geometry of this camera system.
Well, we can remove the camera system and
we can put an eye right
at that focal point.
And this gives us this image plane.
And so basically, when we're looking
out into a three-dimensional scene,
what we're seeing is the same thing that
would be projected onto a two-dimensional
window to the world,
through those same projectors.
Just a certain fixed distance away.
And that's the way we can simulate
with a two-dimensional image,
what the eye would see in
a three-dimensional world.
And, in computer graphics, as we discussed
before with two dimensional graphics,
we're going to simulate
shapes using primitives.
In this case, vector primitives,
except these are now
three-dimensional vector primitives.
And so, we have triangles.
And the triangles are specified
by three vertices.
And those three vertices
have edges between them and
a region we'll call a polygonal face.
And you can create a mesh of
these triangles to define a three
dimensional object.
In this case a bunny rabbit.
And those triangles are then
projected by what's called a three
dimensional graphics pipeline onto
a two-dimensional image plain.
And then the polygons on that
two-dimensional image plane are then
discretized in the pixels.
This is a rasterization process.
And in fact, the same rasterization
process we were discussing.
In two-dimensional graphics where
regions and edges are discretized
into pixels, instead of straight lines and
continuous regions.
And so the way 3-D graphics works is for
each one of these triangles,
each one of these primitives we're
going to figure out its' illumination by
simulating the light coming from
a light source reflecting off of it.
And then we're going to
project that triangle and
its illumination onto this image plane.
And then we're going to
rasterize that triangle
by filling its region in with pixels.
And that's what gets displayed
on the pixel display.
And so we can speak of these
processes as vertex processing,
This is also called transform and
lighting.
Where we're taking vertices of triangles,
and projecting them onto an image plane.
Rasterization, taking those
two dimensional triangles, and
converting them into pixels.
And then, pixel processing,
which takes those pixel regions, and
figures out what colors
should be on their interior.
We also will meet the view
three-dimensional scenes.
We need to figure out where
is the eye in the scene.
And so we'll set up things
like world coordinate systems.
And this eye and
this teapot example, will be
located at positions in three-dimensional
coordinates in the same way that
primitives were located in two-dimensional
coordinates in the previous example.
So we use this world coordinate system,
and its origin is off someplace.
And we can describe everything
relative to this coordinate system.
And we will specify a view.
Basically, where are we and
what are we looking at?
Our eye point will be located at a certain
set of coordinates and world coordinates.
And we'll be looking at a point
also specified as a set of
coordinates in world coordinates,
three coordinates, x, y, z.
And then that view is going to be
transformed into a new coordinate system
that looks very similar to our
canvas coordinate system, so
that we have an x-axis and a y-axis.
And in this case we're extending
from (-1,-1) to (1,1) and
these coordinates are the coordinates
of the window we were looking through
that forms the image plane.
And another thing we want to do is
to create a sense of perspective so
that things farther away appear smaller
and things closer to us, appear larger.
In computer graphics, we do that by
processing the primitives, themselves.
We actually make the things that
are farther away smaller and
the things that are closer to us larger.
So this may look correct for a perspective
scene of a tea pot on a table,
but if I look at it from the side view,
what I've actually done is made
the front of the table larger.
And the back of the table smaller, so that
when it gets projected on to my 2D image
plane, I get correct proportions for
a perspective rendering.
And from this point,
we've processed our primitives, and
we would then rasterized them,
and fill them in,
in the same fashions that we did for
two-dimensional graphics examples.

[SOUND] So, in order to do good,
effective information visualization,
there's a nice information
visualization mantra
that's been set up to
remind us of the steps.
And we'll walk through that mantra and
each of the steps in the next three parts.
So, when visualizing large
amounts of abstract information,
Ben Schneiderman has some really good
advice on how to do that effectively,
that he's formulated into a mantra.
And this mantra goes like this,
you overview first,
then you zoom and filter, and
then provide details only on demand.
And so overview first.
You provide a big picture of the data.
You plot all of the data, but
don't show any details about the data,
giving you some big picture, be able
to understand the data set as a whole.
And then once you can see the whole data
set, you can start to be curious and
focus on a particular area of the data and
so we zoom and
filter, in order to focus on a particular
portion of the data, subset of the data.
And then, once we've found
an appropriate subset to look at,
we can provide details only on demand.
So, details are the individual
details of a single data item.
But only when they're requested, otherwise
plotting that many details about many
items can easily be visually overwhelming.
And so this mantra has been shown to
work really well on a lot examples
of large amounts of abstract information.
So here's a example of Ben Shneiderman's
mantra being used on the World Bank
indicators, to display,
for example, life expectancy and
population for every country in the world.
We start with an overview.
We've got a plot of every country in
the world plotted over population and
life expectancy.
I've zoomed in on the appropriate
areas and ranges of the data,
so the population goes from
a minimum to a maximum.
The life expectancy goes from
its minimum and maximum, and
we can zoom in further as we need to.
I filtered out data, for example,
you can filter based on continent and
I've used that filter to then color
the data based on continent, and
that reveals other information for
example, Africa in general has some low
life expectancies and Asia, in green,
has some high-population countries.
And then you've got details on demand,
for example,
here is one country in Asia that has low
life expectancy, and that's Afghanistan.
And so, by proving those details
on demand, they don't obscure,
overwhelm you visually.
They're the result of interactivity
just as a result of a query, and so
this is a good example of how you
can use Ben Sheniderman's mantra for
the visualizing abstract
information from large data sets.
So the mantra begins with an overview,
to provide an overview of the data first,
and so this overview's often
a scatterplot of the entire dataset.
In this case, I've shown an example.
It's a scatterplot of all the countries
of the world, which is a large
amount of information, and I've plotted
it by population and life expectancy.
And so this is every single country.
I've omitted the labels of each country,
the name of each country,
because that would be a bit overwhelming.
So, we just have a data point for
each country.
And by using these axes we get
a high-level view of all the countries.
We can kind of get our
head around this data set.
And we can already start to
see some interesting issues
that we could be curious about.
For example, some of the countries
have low life expectancy.
There doesn't seem to be a correlation
between population and life expectancy.
And the challenge for this broad overview,
this ability to spread out your data and
to see all of it at once,
is to be able to find axes that do that.
So in this case,
I wanted to look at life expectancy, but
then I've chosen population.
And this choice of populations is
a bit of an arbitrary choice, but
it's one that spreads out the data well.
So for life expectancy, you'll notice
that we don't go from 0 to 85.
We go from 40 to 85 because we've
chosen tight minimum-maximum
bounds to better spread out
the data in this overview.
And for population, I haven't chosen
a linear scale for population,
I've chosen a logarithmic scale for
population that basically displays orders
of magnitude, starting from a billion
going down to 100,000 and less.
And so, this is a logarithmic scale,
because that better spreads
out the data in this case.
So, here's an example of
plotting an overview of your data
that allows you to see all of
your data in one big picture.
This is Tableau, and we're looking
at the World Bank indicators,
and we want to look at, for
example, Life Expectancy.
So if I drag life expectancy
over here as a field,
I get an average life
expectancy over all countries.
Now, if I want to see what
the life expectancy is by country,
I can just drag the country region
into the columns, and now I get
a individual life expectancy average over
the years that were measured, by country.
But this is quite a lot of countries,
and so you don't get a big picture.
This is observable but not displayable.
I can observe all of the data, but I can't
display all the data in a single picture
and still see all of the countries.
So we'd like to provide
a broad overview of
the life expectancy data
over all of the countries.
And in this case, we don't need to see
every country's name, so instead of
doing that, we can just drag the country
region over here into the marks.
And now I've got an individual mark for
every country projected onto a single
line, which doesn't spread the data out.
So, we need a way of spreading it out.
So we can pick, for example,
population, as a way of spreading
out the data horizontally.
And so now, I've plotted the data
by life expectancy vertically,
and by population horizontally.
And there are a few countries,
for example India and China,
that have around a billion people each,
over a billion people each, and
that's skewing the scale of
the rest of these countries.
So in order to spread this data out,
we don't want to use a linear scale,
we want to use a logarithmic scale.
So, I can edit this axis and
choose a logarithmic axis.
And now when I plot logarithmically,
the data gets spread out more evenly
across population because I'm displaying
population by order of magnitude,
factors of ten, instead of linearly.
But now the data is clumped up
in this upper-right quadrant,
so in order to see the data more clearly,
I'll want to spread this out
across the entire display.
So life expectancy,
instead of going from 0 years to 85 years,
I'll want to change that to about
40 years, so I can set the.
Minimum life expectancy to some
lower bound value of say, 40 years.
And now I can use my display resolution
to display more of the items and
to separate more of the items by that,
by setting tighter bounds.
And again by population,
if I set the population,
it looks like it goes from
about 10,000 up to 1 billion.
So, we'll set the lower end of
population to 10,000, instead of zero.
And now that spreads out the data,
and I've got this nice
overview of every single country
in my data set that's spread out.
It's plotting life expectancy,
and it's using population,
actually the logarithm of population
has a way of spreading the data out so
I can get a nice, big overview picture of
the data, so I can further investigate it.

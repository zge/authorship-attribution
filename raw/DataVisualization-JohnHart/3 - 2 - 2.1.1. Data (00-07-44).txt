So we understand how a computer works.
We understand how a human works.
Now we need to understand the data.
The different kinds of data and
how data works its way through
a data visualization system.
And so there's a Data Visualization
Framework that helps us
understand how data is processed for
visualization.
First, data's available to us
from a variety of sources, so
there's a Data Collection operation.
That basically combines the data from
a bunch of different sources and
processes it into one package for
visualization.
Then there is a Mapping Layer,
this mapper that takes the data, and
the data's abstract and whatever
computational representation it may be in,
and it converts it into some
geometric representation,
something concrete, that then
a Graphics Layer can take and display.
And that prepares it for
visualization, for
communication across this visual
channel for human perception.
So the Data Layer Is responsible for
finding the data,
collecting the data
from different sources.
Making sure those sources, which may
have the data in different formats,
that the data can be combined
into a uniform data store.
And making sure that the data is related
between different sources properly.
And then there's some analysis and
aggregation to run statistics on the data,
make sure the data is collected
at the right frequency.
And then that data, once it's in a single
package, is sent to the Mapping Layer,
which assigns the geometry to
corresponding data channels, and
can also perform other rather
sophisticated data processing operations,
things like contouring which take grid
samples and convert them into outlines
of contours that can be useful for
understanding what's going on in the data.
And finally, there's a Graphics Layer and
this converts the geometry into
a displayable image as we saw last week.
It applies Decorations to the geometry.
It assigns color.
It shades the geometry.
It's also responsible for
managing the interactions.
The user input during the visualization.
So that's the framework for
data visualization.
As we look at the actual data involved and
that mapping operation,
it's important to understand some
fundamental features of data,
the types of data that are out there.
And so data can either be Discrete or
Continuous.
Discrete data has Discrete values,
there's no between values.
Whereas Continuous data has values between
neighboring values that are possible.
And then there's comparable data so that
the data can be compared to each other or
Unordered data where
the values are not comparable.
So we look at all the possibilities of
Discrete and Continuous data of Ordered
and Unordered, and you get the different
kinds of data that you'll be dealing with.
For example, Ordinal data.
Ordinal data is data that's ordered,
but discreet.
Things like shirt sizes.
You can say a medium shirt is going
to be larger than a small shirt or
a large shirt is going to be
smaller than a medium shirt.
But there may not be values of
a shirt size between medium and large.
And these can be quantitative
which are discrete and ordered.
For example the counting numbers one,
two, three.
There's not one point five.
So there's no value between 1 and
2 in our counting numbers.
So they're discrete, but yet
2 is greater than 1 so they're ordered.
And so those are examples
of discrete Ordered values.
You can have Continuous Ordered values,
and
these are common real numbers,
the real number line and so on.
and values that we'd use, for example,
for altitude or temperature or
any continuous field of values.
You can also have Unordered data
in discrete and continuous forms.
The discrete form of Unordered data
can be Nominal or Categorical.
Things like shapes
are examples of nominal data.
They're not ordered.
A square, circle and a triangle.
You wouldn't say that
the square is greater than or
less than a circle,
because there's no order between them.
You could have categories.
Different nationalities, or
other other categories for
data that may not necessarily be
comparable and those are discreet.
You can also have continuous
values that are Unordered
often Cyclic values are like this so
directions or
cues, you wouldn't say that north
is any greater or less than east.
And you can having angle going from 0 to
360 in degrees but after you get a 360
degrees, you go back to 0 degrees and so
any one is not greater than any other.
And then hues you could have red,
green, yellow, blue and
you may not say that red is any
greater than green and so these values
are continuous there are colors between
red and green, but you wouldn't
think of red as being greater than or
less than green, so they're unordered.
And finally, when we're treating
data as variables, in science,
you may recall Independent Variables and
Dependent Variables.
And when Independent Variables change,
they can have an effect
on Dependent Variables.
That same notion happens in the data
we get from, for example, Databases.
And so you'll have Key Value pairs, and
Databases will store an index and
then a value associated with that index.
And as the Key changes
the resulting value will change.
So you have this Independent,
Dependent relationship.
In Data Warehouses the Independent
Variable is often a Dimension,
something that's changing
that represents Dimension.
And then the Dependent Variable
is a measure that's happening
as a result of that Dimension.
So a dimension might be time, and
then the measure might be
the temperature at that time of the day.
And so as the time of the day changes,
which is an Independent Variable,
you would have a Dependent Variable,
the Measure, being the temperature
at that time of the day changing.
And you can store that in a Database
as a bunch of times of the day and
then the temperature at that time of
the day as a bunch of Key Value pairs.
And so the data is basically stored
in these Independent, Dependent
relationships in a variety of names
depending on the context of the data.
So the important thing to remember,
the three fundamental kinds of data.
There's Nominal data, there's Ordered
data, and there's Quantitative data.
And we'll be using those distinctions when
we determine how that data ends up being
displayed in a visualization system.

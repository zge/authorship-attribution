So
a second method for dimensionality
reduction is multidimensional scaling.
It focuses on the distance
between related items,
as opposed to their actual positions.
So multidimensional scaling is
a form of dimensionality reduction.
We previously looked at principle
component analysis as a method for
dimensionality reduction.
We have high dimensional data, and
we want to display it on
a low dimensional display.
On just using maybe two or three axes
in order to be able to better visually
perceive the data,
even if the data is high dimensional.
And so we've looked at this in
terms of visualizing graphs.
Graphs encode relationships between data
points where the length of the edge is
irrelevant.
But if we want to look at a graph
where the length is relevant,
we might want to look at ways of
plotting the nodes of a graph or data,
based on the relationship between
data points, based on distance.
So that we can try to preserve
the distance in, for example,
a low dimensional, a two dimensional
visualization of high dimensional data.
We may want the distance between data
points in two dimensions to somehow
indicate the distance between
the data points in higher dimensions.
And so that sets up a metric MDS,
metric multidimensional scaling where
you try to preserve the distance between
data points even though you're displaying
them at a lower dimensional space.
So here's a nice example.
We're not doing dimensionality reduction
because we'll go from a two dimensional
space to a two dimensional space.
But it illustrates how we would compute
a multidimensional scaling to try to
preserve the distance between points.
So here's distances between
cities in the US, for example.
So we've got Boston, NYC, DC, Miami,
Chicago, Seattle, SF, LA, and Denver.
And so the distance between,
for example, Chicago and
NYC would be 803 miles in this example.
So the lower triangle of this data
is showing the distance between
the city on the left and the city in
the row, and the city in the column.
And so there'd be 0 distance
between a city and itself.
And this will be symmetric, so
I haven't bothered to fill in
the upper triangle of this matrix.
So given those distances, dij,
between data points i and j,
between city i and city j, can we
recover the positions of those cities?
So I'm not taking
the coordinates of those cities,
I'm just taking the distances
between those cities.
Basically taking a graph where I'm
specifying the length of the edges between
the nodes.
And then I want to find the positions
of the nodes that satisfies
those edge lengths.
So we can do that by
minimizing this function.
We basically take the distance
between the two data points,
and then we want to subtract their actual
distance, and we want to minimize that.
So if the distance between two data
points equals the desired distance
between those two data points,
then this should be close to zero.
And we square things here so
that we keep everything positive so
that negative values aren't
messing up our minimization.
So we can solve this with any number
of non-linear optimization methods.
In the example I'm going to describe,
I solved it just using
the Excel spreadsheet program
with an optimizer plug-in.
So here's the results that I got,
I minimized that distance
relationship between the actual
distance from my optimized variables and
the desired distance.
And as you can see,
things are obviously in the wrong place.
I've got the East Coast on the left and
West Coast on the east, but
that should still preserve distance.
And there's a few other differences,
but basically I've got this
general east to west trend.
Seattle is above SF and LA,
Denver is here, Chicago is where it's at.
So I've preserved the distance of my
points even though I haven't preserved
the exact geometry of the points.
And so this can be a useful layout method,
especially for high dimensional data when
you're trying to preserve the distances
between the points without necessarily
representing accurately their spatial
configuration, their original coordinates.
So we've thrown away the original
coordinates of these points.
And just using their
distance relationship,
tried to preserve that in a reprojection,
in this case in two dimensions.
So there's all sorts of ways you can
use MDS, multidimensional scaling.
You can visualize affinities
between data points,
areas of collaboration based
on co-authorship of papers.
If you're visualizing papers or the number
of any other attributes two data
points might have in common,
anything you can describe as a distance.
It doesn't have to be coordinate distance,
it can be other similarities.
It's used in human-computer
interaction for
user interface design to
basically lay out buttons.
If you have a dashboard with a lot of
buttons, you can lay out the buttons by
organizing them based on how similar
the buttons are to a given task.
And then,
let multidimensional scaling compute the
coordinates of where the buttons should be
located so that buttons that are used
together are close to each other.
And it's also used in marketing to
create what are called perceptual maps
that are based on survey data of what
people think of different products,
what attributes people assign
to different products.
And then you can figure out what products
are similar to other products and
create a map of products that way.
So, multidimensional scaling
is enabled by optimization.
You don't have to write your
own optimization program,
you can use pre-existing
optimization packages.
You just need something that's going
to minimize a function, and so
you need some form of non-linear
minimization in an optimization package.
I found one that was enabled
in Excel in order to do
the example I described in the slides.

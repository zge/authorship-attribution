This is a Wiimote, a remote control for 
the Wii, video system. 
And it has an infrared camera in here. 
And, it can wirelessly report the 
location of infrared points that it sees 
to the computer. 
Johnny Chung Lee showed we could use this 
as a simple light pen. 
The, the first thing you have to do to 
use it is find the mapping from the 
points in the camera's coordinate system to the points in the screen coordinate 
system. 
[SOUND]. 
Now, how do we find that transformation? 
The transformation can be represented as 
we'll see, by a matrix H. 
And the challenge is, figuring out the 
matrix H. 
We can derive H essentially once we take 
four points whose coordinates in the 
screen coordinate system are known. 
And find their representation in the 
camera coordinate system. 
We're going to use the same math for a 
slightly different problem, removing 
perspective. 
Here's an image taken in my office of a 
whiteboard, taken from an angle. 
Now, there might be some interesting 
linear algebra written on this board. 
But we can't quite get it, because it's 
taken from an angle, so what we'd like to 
do is synthesize a new image from this 
image looking straight at the board, and with 
no perspective at all. 
And here's the result. 
And how do we do that, we use the same 
camera orientated basis as before, 
remember that the origin is at the camera 
center. 
The first vector in the basis goes 
horizontally, the second goes vertically 
and the third goes from the camera 
center. 
From the origin to the top left corner of 
the image sensor array. 
We're going to make use of another 
coordinates system, one that's 
particularly well suited to the to, to 
the, the whiteboard okay. 
In this coordinates system the origin is 
as before, the camera center. 
The first vector in this whiteboard basis 
goes horizontally from the top left 
corner to the top right corner. 
The second vector goes from the top left 
corner vertically down to the bottom left 
corner. 
And the third vector in the basis goes 
from the origin, the camera center, to 
the top left corner of the whiteboard. 
So you have to imagine these vectors in 
the three dimensional world. 
Let's say we have a point in the world 
and we have it's coordinates in terms of 
the camera oriented basis, a1,a2, a3. 
We can write the same point p in terms of 
the whiteboard coordinates system c1, c2, 
c3. 
Here are the coordinates in terms of the 
hammer basis, here are the coordinates in 
terms of the whiteboard basis. 
Now combining these two equations we get 
this equals this because of course, it's 
the same point. 
So we've got this equation, and I'm 
going to basically be recapitulating an 
argument I made earlier. 
having to do with change of basis. 
Let a and c be there two matrices and as 
before, when we were discussing, change 
of basis, this matrix c has an inverse, c 
inverse. 
Let's multiple this equation on the left, 
by c inverse and we get, this equation. 
Now, C inverse in C, cancel out, giving 
the identity matrix, which multiplied by 
this vector, doesn't change it. 
So we get this equation. 
So, the product of the matrix C inverse, 
and A, is a matrix H, such that H times 
the corner representation with respect to 
a1, a2 ,a3 equals the quarter representation with 
respect to c1, c2 and c3. 
The challenge is computing H. 
We don't actually compute this matrix H 
by multiplying two matrices, we compute 
it by solving equations. 
We think about the entries of the matrix 
H as unknowns. 
We set up some equations in, in these 
unknowns, and we'll use the solver module 
to solve this. 
The math is a little hard to follow. 
It'll make more sense once you start 
actually doing this. 
So to derive the equations, let p be some 
point on the whiteboard. 
And let q be the corresponding point in 
the image plane. 
Let x1 x2 and 1 be the camera coordinates 
of the point q in the image plane. 
that is, the coordinates with respect to 
the camera basis. 
And that, y1, y2, y3 be the white, whiteboard 
coordinates of the same point q. 
So then we have that the vector y1, y2, 
y3 is the matrix, h times x1, x2, and 1. 
Now let's multiply everything out 
and we get these equations. 
So here are the equations. 
The white board coordinates of the 
original point, p, are y1 divided by y3, 
y2 divided by y3, and y3 divided by y3, 
which is 1. 
So let's define w1 to be y1 over y3, and 
w2 to be y2 over y3. 
So we can write the whiteboard 
coordinates of this original point p as 
w1, w2, and 1. 
Now, let's multiply through these 
equations, by y3. 
So we get these equations. 
Now, we use these to substitute for y1, 
and y2, and y3 in the, in these equations 
and we get these equations. 
Now, finally multiplying through and 
moving things to the other side, we get 
these fairly complicated equations. 
The equations are equations in the 
unknown h entries. 
And the coefficients in these equations 
are known values. 
They're, coordinates of points we know 
about. 
So, we got two equations, in these 
unknowns from looking at a point in the 
whiteboard and the corresponding point in 
the in the image plain. 
Now that gives us two equations we're 
going to take 4 points in the whiteboard. 
Namely the four corners of a whiteboard 
and find out using an image viewer the 
coordinates of those points in the in the 
image plane. 
We find out which pixels they correspond 
to. 
We can use that in this way to derive 
eight equations in the unknown entries of 
the matrix age. 
Unfortunately, there are nine entries in 
the matrix age, so that doesn't quite 
give us enough information. 
We need one more equation. 
But it turns out, we can't figure out 
what H is from these points after 
all. 
This corresponds to the fact, that we 
don't know the scale of, of the image, 
okay. 
A tiny building that's nearby looks just 
like a, a huge building that, that's far 
away. 
But it turns out, that doesn't matter. 
The scale of the image doesn't matter 
when we're doing this transformation. 
So we don't have to pin down exactly H. 
As long as the H we compute is a scalar 
multiple of the true matrix H 
we'll be able to perform the 
transformation just fine. 
So in order to pin down some H, we just 
add an equation. 
We specify that one of the entries is 
one. 
And that should work out okay. 
Again, the math is fairly confusing. 
Once you start actually performing these 
calculations, I'm hoping it'll become 
more clear to you. 
Alright, let's say we've computed the 
matrix age. 
How can we use this to synthesize an 
image without perspective? 
An image of the white board without 
perspective? 
We have an image, it's a, it's a grid of 
pixels. 
Each pixel is a rectangle of color. 
What we have to do is, transform that 
rectangle to find out the corresponding 
quadrilateral in the white board. 
So, we know the coordinates of the little 
rectangle in in the image plane, 
it's given by the, by, by the camera 
coordinates. 
What we want to do is find out the 
corresponding points in the white board 
coordinate system. 
So we start with a point, q, in the 
representation of the image, and we have 
its camera coordinates. 
We have, we know what pixels it 
corresponds to. 
Take each point, each corner of a pixel, 
multiply it by H to get the 
representation of the same point with 
respect to the whiteboard coordinates. 
Given the representation with respect to the whiteboard coordinates, it's easy to find the corresponding point on the whiteboard. So here's a point in the image plane, we want to map it to this corresponding point in the whiteboard. And we know that the way to do that is to 
just scale down. 
Divide these coordinates by the third 
coordinate. 
And that gives us the point in the whiteboard. 
 
So you you white a program to carry that 
out for each corner of each rectangle of 
color in the image. 
Transform those and you'll get a new 
image that's of the whiteboard with no 
perspective looking straight on. 
This will be more clear when you start 
doing the lab and it's spelled out in 
greater detail in the lab assignment.

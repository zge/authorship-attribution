Let's say we have a bunch of vectors v1 
through vn. 
We multiply each of them by a scalar and 
we add the results up. 
That's called a linear combination of the 
vectors v1 through vn. 
And the scalars in this context are 
called the coefficients, so the 
coefficient, in this case of V1 is alpha 
one. 
So, here's a simple example, one linear combination of these two 
vectors is this. 
Multiply the first one by minus 5, the 
second by 2, and add the result. 
So, it's equal to this. 
Now, another linear combination of the 
same vectors is, multiply the first one 
by zero, the second one by zero, add them 
up, and of course you end up with the all 
zeros vector. 
A linear combination where all the 
coefficients are zero is called the 
trivial linear combination. 
There's a factory called JunkCo that 
makes a bunch of products, a garden 
gnome, a hula hoop, and so on. 
There's a table that specifies for each 
product how much it uses in each of five 
resources. 
For example, making a garden gnome takes 
zero units of metal, 1.3 units of 
concrete, and so on. 
So, for each product, we can write down a 
vector that specifies how much of each 
resource it uses. 
So, for example, for making a garden 
gnome. 
The vector maps metal to zero, concrete 
to 1.3, and so on. 
So there's a vector like this for each of 
the products that JunkCo makes. 
Now, suppose the factory decides to make 
alpha one garden gnomes, alpha two hula 
hoops, and so on. 
Then the total amount of each of the 
resource is specified by a vector that 
can be expressed as a linear combination 
of the vectors v1 through v5. 
In fact, I don't know how much of each 
product JunkCo makes. 
That's what I want to find out. 
I want to carry out industrial espionage 
to figure out exactly how many garden 
gnomes JunkCo was making. 
How can I do that? 
Well, let's say I know how much of each 
resource they are consuming. 
I know the vector b in this equation. 
And I know the vectors v1 through v5, 
because I know how much resources making 
a garden gnome requires. 
I want to figure out alpha one through 
alpha five. 
How can I do that? 
This raises the following computational 
problem. 
Given a vector b, and a list of vectors v1 
 through vn, can you compute the coefficients with 
which v is expressed as a linear 
combination of v1 through vn. 
And even if we can compute that, am I 
going to get the right answer? 
In fact, is there a single right answer? 
Here's another example. 
Recall lights out. 
I'm going to use, for simplicity I'll use 
the two by two lights out as an example. 
Here are the button vectors for lights 
out. 
And here's an initial state vector. 
For this initial state vector, I want to 
know how do I solve the puzzle? 
In particular, which subset of the button 
vectors have to be pressed in order to 
transform this to the all lights out 
state. 
We can express that problem in terms of 
linear combinations. 
We write that desired state vector as a 
linear combination of the button vectors. 
And we ask what values of alpha do I need 
to make this true? 
Okay, and here's the solution. 
We know that solving an instance of lights 
out can be transformed into the question of 
which set of button vectors add up to the 
target state s. 
A more general version of that is, given 
vectors v1 through vn, which subset of 
those vectors sums to a vector s. 
And we that this question can be 
reformulated as the question of how to 
express s as a linear combination of v1 
through vn. 
So, we can solve that puzzle if we have 
an algorithm for the following 
computational problem. 
Expressing a giving factor as a linear 
combination of other vectors.

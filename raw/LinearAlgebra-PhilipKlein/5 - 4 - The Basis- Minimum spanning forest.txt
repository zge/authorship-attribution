I'll illustrate some of the concepts with 
a graph problem. 
Now, this is a graph. 
These are the nodes, they represent areas 
of a university, and these are the edges. 
Now, a sequence of edges Where the second 
element of the first edge matches the 
first element of the second edge, the 
second element of the second edge matches 
the first element of the third edge, and 
so on is called a path. 
It's an x1 to xk path if the first 
element of the first edge is x1 and the 
last, second element of the last edge is 
x k. 
So for example, here is a path from Main 
Quad to Gregorian. 
Another path goes this way. 
Now a cycle is a collection of edges that 
form a path starting and ending at the 
same place. 
So, here the dark edges form a cycle. 
A set of edges in a graph is spanning if 
for every edge of the graph, there's a 
path in the set of edges connecting the 
two endpoints of the edge. 
For example, let s be the set of dark 
edges in this diagram. 
This is a spanning set. 
For example, consider the edge between 
biomed and atheletic. 
Its end points are connected by a path 
using edges of the set. 
The edge from Main to Keeney its end 
points are connected by a couple of paths 
among the edges in the set. 
So this is a spanning set. 
Now, later on, we'll understand the 
connection between this use of spanning 
and the use and connection with vectors. 
A set of edges in a graph is a forest if 
the set includes no cycles. 
So, for example, the set of dark edges 
illustrated here is not a forest, because 
there is a cycle here. 
If we remove one of those edges, the 
resulting set of dark edges is a forest. 
The minimum spanning forest problem is a 
fundamental problem in graph algorithms. 
The input is a graph and an assignment of 
weights to edges. 
And the output is a set of edges that is 
spanning and a forest and subject to 
those requirements has minimum weight. 
So, this might come up, for example, in 
an application in which you must select 
some of these edges to form a network 
that can deliver hot water between 
different areas of a campus. 
The network must achieve the same 
connectivity as the input graph. 
And the edge weights, represent the cost of 
installing pipes between the endpoints of 
the edges and the goal is, to find a set 
of edges that's spanning and of minimum 
cost. 
It will turn out because the edges all 
have positive weight that the solution 
will be a forest. 
Let's consider algorithms for this 
fundamental problem. 
There are two natural approaches you 
might take to coming up with a solution. 
One is called the Grow algorithm. 
Given a graph, start by initializing the 
set s to be the empty set. 
And consider the edges of this graph in 
increasing order of weight. 
For each edge in turn, consider whether 
its end points are already connected 
by a path, using edges in the set s of 
edges selected so far. 
If not, add that edge to the set s. 
If so, move on to the next edge in 
increasing order of weight. 
Let's try this out. 
The first edge is the weight two edge. 
Now, so far, we've selected no edges. 
So certainly, these end points are not 
connected using the edges selected so 
far. 
So we'll add this to our set of selected 
edges. 
Next edge is 3. 
All right. 
The endpoints are not yet connected, so 
we'll add this edge. 
Next is 4. 
Its endpoints are not connected, so we 
add that edge. 
5, up. 
Now, the endpoints of the edge with 
weight 5 are already connected using 
edges we've selected. 
So we skip 5. 
Moving on to 6, it's endpoints are not 
connected so we add that edge in. 
7, it's endpoints are not yet connected 
so we add that edge. 
8, oh, it's endpoints are already 
connected. 
Using a path of edges already selected. 
So we skip 8, and 9, its end points are 
also already connected. 
We've run out of edges so that's our 
solution. 
Is it indeed a minimum spanning forest? 
Here's another natural algorithm for 
solving the minimum spanning forest 
problem. 
I call it the Shrink algorithm. 
You start by initalizing S to the set of 
all edges. 
And now you consider the edges in 
decreasing order of weight. 
For each edge in turn, if removing that 
edge still leaves a path among the 
selected edges, between the end points of 
the edge, then go ahead and remove that 
edge. 
Let's try it out. 
We start with the heaviest edge. 
The one of wake nine. 
Now, removing this edge will leave its 
end points connected using the edges we 
haven't yet removed. 
So we can cross that out. 
Now, we go to 8. 
Removing the edge with weight 8 is safe. 
We go to 7. 
Removing the edge with weight 7 would 
remove the endpoints of that edge without 
a path between them among the edges. 
We've kept so we don't remove 7. 
Six if we remove the edge with weight 6 
there won't be a path between its 
endpoints among the edges we haven't yet 
eliminated. 
So we leave that in. 
5, well, we can remove this edge. 
Because its endpoints are connected using 
edges we have. 
4, if we remove this edge, there won't be 
a path, so we leave that in. 
3, the same. 
We leave that in. 
And 2, we'd better leave that in. 
So, this is the set of edges selected by 
the shrink algorithm. 
Is this truly a minimum spanning forest? 
You might've noticed that the grow 
algorithm for minimum spanning forest 
closely resembles the grow algorithm for 
building up a set of generators. 
And the shrink algorithm for minimum 
spanning forest, closely resembles the 
shrink algorithm For finding possibly 
small set of generators. 
It's not a coincidence, we can formulate 
minimum spanning force as a problem in 
linear algebra. 
So here we start with a graph. 
We'll let d the domain of our vectors be 
the set of, of notes. 
Now, we can represent a subset of d by a 
vector over g of 2. 
We just put a one in every position 
represented by, in the set. 
So the set Pembroke, Main, and Gregorian 
is represented by this vector, which has 
ones precisely in the positions Pembroke, 
Main and Gregorian. 
So here's the representation of all the 
edges in this graph. 
For example, the edge between Pembroke 
and Athletic is represented by this 
vector that has a one in Pembroke and a 
one in Athletic and the rest are zeroes. 
Now, the vector representing the subset 
Keeney Gregorian this vector is the sum 
of of the vectors representing the, the 
set Keeney Main. 
Main, Wriston and Wriston, Gregorian. 
So let's see that. 
Here's the vector for Keeney, Main. 
Here's the vector for Main, Wriston. 
And here's the vector for Wriston, 
Gregorian. 
If we add up these vectors, the ones in 
this column Sum to 0. 
The ones in this column sum to 0. 
And we're just left with 1's in the 
positions Keeney and Gregorian. 
A vector with 1's in entries x and y is 
the sum of vectors corresponding to edges 
that trace out an x to y path in the 
graph. 
In this case the path from Keeney 
Gregorian through Main and Wriston. 
So here's another example. 
Each of these sets represents one of the 
edges shown in dark here. 
The span of the corresponding vectors. 
Contains, for example, the vector Main 
Keeney because there's a path from Main 
to Keeney using those dark edges. 
It contains the vector Keeney Gregorian 
because there's a path from Keeney to 
Gregorian using those edges. 
But it doesn't include, for example the 
pair athletic and biomed, because there's 
no path using dark edges between those 
two nodes. 
Similarly, it doesn't represent the pair, 
athletic and main. 
Or biomed and main because there's no 
path of dark edges connecting those two 
nodes. 
Here's the grow algorithm for minimum 
spanning force and here's the grow 
algorithm for vectors. 
Considering the edges of the graph. 
Corresponds to considering vectors in the 
vector space. 
Testing whether an edge's endpoints are 
connected using edges we've already added 
to s corresponds to testing if a vector 
lies in the span of the vectors we've 
already selected. 
So the grow algorithm. 
For minimum spanning forest, there is a 
specialization of the Grow algorithm for 
vectors. 
We can force this to make choices that 
exactly mimic the execution of this 
algorithm.

The set of all linear combinations of 
vectors v1 through vn is called the span 
of those vectors. 
It's written this way. 
Let's go back to the challenge response 
system. 
So Eve knows the password satisfies a 
bunch of equations. 
She can calculate the response to any 
challenge that lies in the span of the 
vectors a1 through am. 
Here's how. 
So, any vector in the span can be 
represented as a linear combination of 
the vectors a1 through am. 
Now we use the distributive law, the dot 
product of a with the password x, by the 
distributive law is the sum of the dot 
products of these vectors. 
Now, we use another algebraic property to 
move the alphas out. 
And Eve knows these dot products because 
she's observed the challenge and the 
response. So she plugs in the responses 
to those challenges, and she can get the 
response to a. 
So this shows that she can get, she can 
compute the response to any challenge 
that lies in the span of a1 through 
am. 
Are there any other challenges for which 
you can derive the response? 
The answer to that question will have to 
wait. 
[BLANK_AUDIO]. 
Here's an example. 
How many vectors are there in the span of 
this set consisting of just one vector 
over GF1, 2? 
Well, there are two possible 
coefficients, zero and one. 
So, turns out there are two vectors in 
the span. 
How many vectors are there in the span of 
an empty set? 
Well, there's only one, the zero vector. 
How many vectors are there in the span of 
this single vector over the real numbers? 
There are an infinite number. 
And these, these linear combinations form 
a line 
through the origin and the 0.23. 
Let big V be a set of vectors. 
If v1 through vn are vectors such that 
big V equals span of v1 through vn, we 
say that v1 through vn form a generating 
set for big V. 
We refer to these as generators. 
Here's an example. 
I've claimed that these vectors are a 
generating set for R3. 
So why is that? 
We have to toe, show two things. 
First that every linear combination of 
these vectors lays in R3 and every vector 
in R3 is some linear combination of these 
three vectors. 
The first statement is pretty easy. 
Each of these vectors is in R3. 
You multiply them by scalars, they're 
still in R3, you add them together. 
Still in R3. 
What about the second statement? 
We proved this as false. 
Let x, y, z be any element of R3. 
And I want to show that I can express 
this vector as a linear combination of 
these three vectors. 
Well here's the formula of that. 
The vector x,y,z can be expressed as x 
over 3 times the third vector plus y over 
2 times the second vector plus z times 
the third vector. 
Now I claim that this is another 
generating set for R3. 
Now another way of showing that every 
vector in R3 is in the span of 
these vectors is this, we already know 
that R3 is equal to the span of 
these old vectors. 
What I'm going to do is show that each of 
these old vectors is in the span of the 
new vector. 
I do that by exhibiting a linear 
combination. 
The first vector is three times the old 
vector. 
The second vector is minus 2 times the 
first old vector, plus 2 times the second 
old vector, and so on. 
So I've shown that the new vectors are in 
the span of the old vectors. 
Now, why does that do the job? 
Well, we already know that any vector in 
R3 can be written as a linear combination 
of the old vectors. 
And we know that each of the old vectors 
can be written as a linear combination of 
the new vectors. 
To put these together, we use the fact 
that a linear combination of linear 
combinations can be reduced to just a 
linear combination. 
Let's see how that goes. 
So, we write x, y, z as a linear 
combination of the old vectors. 
Then, we replace each of the old vectors 
with an equivalent linear combination. 
So we're just substituting from the 
equations on the previous slide. 
Now we multiply through, using our 
algebraic properties. 
And then we collect like terms. 
And we end up with a linear combination 
in terms of the new vectors. 
Now, writing the vector x, y, z as a 
linear combination of these vectors was 
easy, because these have a special form. 
It's even easier if we have a slightly 
more special form. 
If we use the vectors [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 
0], and [0, 0, 1], because then the 
linear combination looks like this: x, y, 
z is x times the first vector, plus y 
times the second vector, plus z times the 
third vector. 
We call these, standard generators for 
R3. 
And they're traditionally written e1, e2, 
and e3. 
Here's a way we can use standard 
generators. 
Consider the question, can 2 by 2 Lights 
Out be solved regardless of the starting 
position? 
What we're asking is whether the 2 by 2 
button vectors are generators for the set 
of all initial states. 
The answer is yes. 
And here's how we prove it. 
We show that each of the standard 
generators [BLANK_AUDIO] can be written 
as a linear combination of the button 
vectors. 
So these are the standard vectors for for 
2 by 2 Lights Out. 
And we've written each of them as a 
linear combination of the button vectors. 
We already know that the set of all 
states is, is the span of the 
standard generators, and now we've shown 
each of the standard generators in turn 
can be written in terms of the button 
vectors. 
It follows that each of the possible 
states for 2 by 2 Lights Out can be 
written as a linear combination of the 
button vectors.

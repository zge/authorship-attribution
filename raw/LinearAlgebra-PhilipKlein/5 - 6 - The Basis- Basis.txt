So, we see that if they successfully 
complete the Grow Algorithm and the 
Shrink Algorithm, it will produce 
linearly independent sets of vectors. 
Let big V be a vector space. 
A basis for V is a linearly independent 
set of generators. 
So, a basis for big V is a set of 
generators with two properties. 
The vectors span big V and the set of 
vectors is linearly independent. 
So, this is the most important definition 
in all of linear algebra. 
Here's some examples. 
We know that the, a basis must satisfy 
these two properties, spanning property 
and the independence property. 
Let big V be the span of these three 
vectors. 
Is this a basis for big V? 
Well, no, we've seen that though it's a 
set of spanning, it's not linearly 
independent. 
In fact, here's a linear combination, a 
non-trivial linear combination that 
equals the 0 vector. 
So, it's not a basis. 
On the other hand, we take one of these 
vectors out, it is a basis. 
It's obvious that these vectors are 
linearly independent because this one has 
a non-zero entry in the, a non-zero first 
entry. 
And this one has a zero first entry, 
whereas this one has a non-zero second 
entry and this has a zero second entry. 
So, using an argument described earlier, 
we can show that any linear combination 
that equals the zero vector must be 
trivial. 
How do we show though, that these two 
vectors are spanning? 
Well, we can, we can write the third 
vector, the missing vector, as a linear 
combination of these two vectors. 
Therefore, by the Superfluous-Vector 
Lemma, the the set span by the three 
vectors equals the set spanned by the 
three vectors, minus the third vector. 
Here's a very simple example of a basis, 
a basis for R3. 
These are the standard generators. 
It's easy to see that this set of vectors 
spans R3 because for any vector in R3 we 
can easily write it as a linear 
combination of those three vectors. 
We can argue as before that these vectors 
are linearly independent. 
Suppose, you could write zero as a linear 
combination of these vectors. 
Let's add up the linear combination. 
We get alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3. 
Well, if that's equal to the zero vector 
it must be that alpha1, alpha 2, and 
alpha 3 are all zero. 
That is that the linear combination is 
trivial. 
So, that shows those vectors are linearly 
independent. 
Now, instead of standard generators, 
we'll call them standard basis vectors. 
We refer to the set of these vectors as 
the standard basis for R3. 
And in general, the standard generators 
are really called standard basis vectors. 
Here's another example of the basis. 
These vectors form a basis. 
To see that we have to show that they're 
spanning, and that they're linearly 
independent. 
First, to see that they're spanning, we 
can write the standard generators as 
linear combinations of these new vectors. 
Since the standard generators can be 
written in terms of the new vectors, it 
follows that every vector in the span of 
these standard generators is in the span 
of the new vectors as well. 
Since the span of the standard generators 
is R3, that shows that R3 equals the span 
of the new vectors. 
Now, we see that the vectors are linearly 
independent. 
Suppose we write the zero vector as a 
linear combination of these vectors. 
Summing it up, we get this. 
And equating corresponding entries, we 
see that x plus y equals 0, x plus y plus 
z equals 0, and x plus z equals 0. 
Now, if we plug x plus y equals 0. 
Into the second equation, we see that z 
equals 0. 
We plug z equals 0 into this third 
equation, we get x equals 0, and we plug 
x equals 0 into the first equation, we 
get y equals 0. 
So, that shows that the linear 
combination is trivial, and therefore 
these vectors are linearly independent. 
Now, in graphs, one kind of basis is a 
set of edges forming a spanning forest. 
The fact that, that, it's spanning follows 
from the fact that for every edge xy in 
G, there's an x to y path consisting of 
edges in the set. 
The fact that it's linearly independent 
corresponds to the fact that these edges 
form no cycle. 
So, here's an example of a spanning 
forest in the graph. 
There are no cycles and every edge in the 
original graph has its end points 
connected using edges in the set of dark 
edges. 
Here's another example of a spanning 
forest for the same graph. 
Now, we'd like to say that every vector 
space has a basis. 
And we have a, a good approach to doing 
that, the Grow Algorithm and the Shrink 
Algorithm provide, linearly independent sets that 
span a given vector space. 
So, we'd like to say that those 
algorithms prove that every vector space 
has a basis, but we're not quite there 
yet. 
The Grow-Algorithm Corollary states that 
if the Grow algorithm terminates, it 
terminates with a linear, linearly 
independent and spanning set of vectors. 
But we don't know whether the 
Grow-algorithm always stops, whether it 
successfully completes. 
Now, the Shrink-Algorithm Corollary 
states that if we can run the algorithm, 
at the end, it will give us a linearly 
independent and spanning set of vectors. 
But in order to run it, we have to 
initialize the set S with a finite set of 
vectors that spans the vector space. 
So, we haven't shown yet that there is 
even a finite set of vectors that spans 
every vector space. 
And this is not a merely technical 
matter. 
In the wider world of Mathematics, one 
has to deal with vector spaces for which 
there's no finite set of vectors that 
span it. 
In this course however, we're going to 
keep things simple and it'll turn out 
that every vector space does have a 
finite set of generators and that every 
vector space has a basis. 
There are two natural ways to specify a 
vector space. 
One is by specifying generators for that 
vector space, and the other is specifying 
a homogeneous linear system whose 
solution set is the vector space. 
So, this raises two fundamental 
computational problems. 
Finding a basis of the vector space given 
by generators. 
That is, given a list of vectors, find a 
basis for the space spanned by those 
vectors and finding a basis for the 
solution set of a homogeneous linear 
system. 
That is, given a list of vectors, say a1 
through an 
find a list of vectors that form a basis 
for the set of solutions to the 
homeogenous linear system a1.x equals 0, 
and so on.

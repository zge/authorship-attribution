Recall the idea of a coordinate system 
for a vector space V. 
We have generators a1 through an say of 
the vector space V. 
So, that every vector in V can be written 
as a linear combination of the 
generators. 
And we represent a vector V by its 
coordinate representation that is, the 
vector formed by the coefficients in this 
linear combination. 
And we raise the question, how can we 
ensure that every vector has just one 
coordinate representation. 
The answer is to ensure that these 
generators form a basis. 
So, we'll prove the Unique-Representation 
Lemma which says that if a1 through an are a 
basis for a vector space V, then for any 
vector little v in that vector space, 
there is exactly one representation of 
that vector in terms of those basis 
vectors. 
So, here's the proof. 
Let v be any vector in the vector space. 
Now, the vectors a1 through an span the 
vector space, so there's at least one way 
of representing v as a linear 
combination. 
Suppose there are two such 
representations with the coefficients alpha 1 through 
alpha n and the coefficients beta 1 
through beta n. 
Now, by subtracting one from the other, 
we get the 0 vector. 
And now, by collecting coefficients 
corresponding to the same vectors, we get 
zero as this linear combination. 
Now, because those vectors are linearly 
independent, it follows that the 
coefficients must all be zero. 
It must be a trivial linear combination. 
So, alpha 1 minus beta 1 equals 0, and so 
on. 
And that shows that alpha 1 equals beta 1 
and so on. 
So, the two representations are actually 
just one. 
A basis in a graph is a spanning force 
and the Unique Representation Lemma shows 
us that for each edge xy in the graph, 
there is a path from x to y in the 
spanning force, and there's only one such 
path.

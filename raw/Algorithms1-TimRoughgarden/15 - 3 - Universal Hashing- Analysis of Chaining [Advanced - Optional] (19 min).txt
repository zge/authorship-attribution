So, in this video, we're going to start
reasoning about the performance of hash
tables. In particular, we'll make precise
this idea that properly implemented they
guarantee constant time lookup. So, let me
just briefly remind you of the road map
that we're in the middle of. So, we
observed that every fixed hash function is
subject to a pathological data set and so
exploring the solution of making a real
time decision of what hash function to
use. And we've already gone over this
really quite interesting definition of
universal hash functions and that's the
proposed definition of a good random hash
function. More over, in the previous video
I showed you that there are simple such
families of hash functions. They don't
take much space to store, they don't take
much time to evaluate. And the plan for
this video is to prove formally, that if
you draw a hash function uniformly at
random from a universal family of hash
functions, like the one we saw in the
previous video, then you're guaranteed
expected constant time for all of the
supported operations. So, here's the
definition once more of a universal family
of hash functions. We'll be using this
definition, of course, when we prove that
these hash functions give good
performance. So, remember, we're talking
now about a set of hash functions. These
are all of the conceivable real time
decisions you might make about which hash
function to use. So, the universe is
fixed, this is something like IP
addresses, the number of buckets is fixed.
You know that's going to be something like
10,000, say, and what it means for a
family to be universal is that the
probability that any given pair of items
collides is as good, as small as with the
gold standard of completely perfect
uniform random hashing. That is for each
pair xy of distinct elements of the
universe, so for example, for each
distinct pair of IP addresses, the
probability over the choice of the random
hash function little h from the family
script h is no more than one over n, where
n is the number of buckets. So, if you
have 10,000 buckets, the probability that
any given pair of IP addresses winds up
getting mapped to the same bucket is
almost one in 10,000. Let me now spell out
the precise guarantee we're going to prove
if you use a randomly chosen hash function
from a universal family. So, for this
video, we're going to only talk about hash
tables implemented with chaining, with one
length list per bucket. We'll be able to
give a completely precise mathematical
analysis with this collision resolution
scheme. We're going to analyze the
performance of this hash table in
expectation over the choice of a hash
function little h drawn uniformly from a
universal family script h. So, for
example, for the family that we
constructed in the previous video, this
just amounts to choosing each of the four
coefficients uniformly at random. That's
how you select a universal, that's how you
select a hash function uniformly at
random. So, this theorem and also the
definition of universal hash functions
dates back to a 1979 research paper by
Carter and Wegman. The idea of hashing
dates back quite a bit before that,
certainly to the 50s. So, this just kind
of shows us sometimes ideas have to be
percolating for awhile before you find the
right way to explain what's going on. So,
Carter and Wegman provided this very clean
and modular way of thinking about
performance of hashing through this
universal hashing definition. And the
guarantee is exactly the one that I
promised way back when we talked about
what operations are supported by hash
tables and what kind of performance should
you expect, you should expect constant
time performance. As always, with hashing,
there is some fine print so let me just be
precise about what the caveats of this
guarantee are. So, first of all,
necessarily this guarantee is an
expectation. So, it's on average over the
choice of the hash function, little h. But
I want to reiterate that this guarantee
does hold for an arbitrary data set. So,
this guarantee is quite reminiscent of the
one we had for the rand omized quick sort
algorithm. In Quicksort, we made no
assumptions about the data. It was a
completely arbitrary input array and the
guarantee said, on average over the real
time randomized decisions of the
algorithm, no matter what the input is,
the expected running time was in log in.
Here we're saying again, no assumptions
about the data. It doesn't matter what
you're storing in the hash table and
expectation over the real time random
decision of what hash function you use,
you should expect constant time
performance, no matter what that data set
is. So, the second caveat is something
we've talked about before. Remember, the
key to having good hash table performance,
not only do you need a good hash function
which is what this universality key is
providing us but you also need to control
the load of the hash table. So, of course,
to get constant time performance, as we've
discussed, a necessary condition is that
you have enough buckets to hold more or
less the stuff that you're storing. That
is the load, alpha, the number of objects
in the table divided by the number of
buckets should be constant for this
theorem to hold. And finally, whenever you
do a hash table operation, you have to in
particular invoke the hash function on
whatever key you're given. So, in order to
have constant time performance, it better
be the case that it only takes constant
time to evaluate your hash function and
that's, of course, something we also
discussed in the previous video when we
emphasized the importance of having simple
universal hash functions like those random
linear combinations we discussed in the
previous video. In general, the
mathematical analysis of hash table
performance is a quite deep field, and
there is some, quite mathematically
interesting results that are well outside
the scope of this course. But what's cool,
in this theorem I will be able to provide
you a full and rigorous proof. So, for
hash tables with chaining and using
randomly chosen universal hash functions,
I'm going to now prove that you do get
cons tant time performance. Right, so hash
tables support various operations, Insert,
Delete and Lookup. But really if we can
just bound a running time of an
unsuccessful lookup, that's going to be
enough to bound the running time of all of
these operations. So, remember in hash
table with chaining, you first hash the
appropriate bucket and then you do the
appropriate Insert, Delete or Lookup in
the link list in that bucket. So, the
worst case as far as traversing though
this length list is if you're looking for
something but it's not there cuz you have
to look at every single element in the
list and followup into the list before you
can conclude that the lookup has failed.
Of course, insertion, as we discussed, is
always constant time, deletion and
successful searches, well, you might get
lucky, and stop early before you hit the
end of the list. So, all we're going to do
is bother to analyze unsuccessful lookups
that will carry over to all of the other
operations. So, a little more precisely,
let's let s be the data set. This is the
objects that we are storing in our hash
table. And remember that to get constant
time lookup, it really needs to be the
case that the load is constant. So, we are
assuming that the size of s is bigger over
the number of buckets n. And let's suppose
we are searching for some other object
which is not an s, call it x. And again, I
want to emphasize we are making no
assumptions about what this data set s is
other than that the size is comparable to
the number of buckets. So, conceptually
doing a lookup in a hash table with
chaining is a very simple thing. You just
hash to the appropriate bucket and then
you scan through the length list in that
bucket. So, conceptually, it's very easy
to write down the what the running time of
this unsuccessful lookup is. It's got two
parts. So, the first thing you do is you
evaluate the hash function to figure out
the right bucket. And again, remember
we're assuming that we have a simple of a
hash function and it takes constant time.
Now, of course, the magic of hash
functions is that given that this hash
value, we can zip right to where the
lenght list is to search for x using
random access into our array of buckets.
So, we go straight to the appropriate
place in our array of buckets and we just
search through the list ultimately failing
to find what we're looking for s.
Traversing a link list, as you all know,
it takes time proportional to the length
of the list. So, we find something that we
discussed informally in the past which is
that's the running time of hash table
operations implemented with chaining is
governed by the list lengths. So, that's
really the key quantity we have to
understand. So, lets call this, lets give
this a name, Capital L, it's important
enough to give a name. So, what I want you
to appreciate at this point is that this
key quantity, Capital L, the list of the
length in x's bucket is a random variable.
It is a function of which hash function
little h, we wind up selecting in a real
time. So, for some choices of our hash
function, little h, this list length might
be as small as zero but for other choices
of this hash function h, this list, list
length could be bigger. So, this is
exactly analogous too in Quicksort where
depending on the real time decision of
which random pivot element you use, your
going to get a different number of
comparisons, a different running time. So,
the list length and hence the time for the
unsuccessful storage, depends on the hash
function little h, which we're choosing at
random. So, let's recall what it is we're
trying to prove. We're trying to prove an
upper bound on the running time of an
unsuccessful lookup on average, where the
on average is over the choice of the hash
function little h. We've expressed that
this lookup time in terms of the average
list length in x's bucket where again the
average is over the random choice of h.
Summarizing, we've reduced what we care
about, expected time for lookup to
understanding the expected value of this
random variable Capital L, the average
list length in x's bucket. So, that's what
we've got to do, we've got to compute the
expected value of this random variable,
Capital L. Now to do that, I want to jog
your memory of a general technique for
analyzing expectations which you haven't
seen in awhile. The last time we saw it, I
believe, was when we were doing the
analysis of randomized Quicksort and
counting its comparisons. So, here's a
general decomposition principle which
we're now going to use in exactly the same
way as we did in Quicksort here to analyze
the performance of hashing with chaining.
So, this is where you want to understand
the expect, expectation of random variable
which is complicated but what you can
express as the sum of much simpler random
variables. Ideally, 0,1 or indicator
random variables. So, the first step is to
figure out the random variable, Capital Y,
it's what I'm calling it here that you
really care about. Now, we finished the
last slide, completing step one. What we
really care about is Capital L, the list
length in x's bucket. So, that governs the
running time a bit unsuccessful Look up,
clearly that's what we really care about.
Step two of the decomposition principle is
well, you know, the random variable you
care about is complicated, hard to analyze
directly but decompose it as a sum of 0,1
indicator random variable. So, that's what
we're going to do in the beginning of the
next slide. Why is it useful to decompose
a complicated random variable into the sum
of 0,1random variables? Well, then you're
in the wheelhouse of linear of
expectations. You get that the expected
value of the random variable that you care
about is just the sum of the expected
values of the different indicator random
variables and those expectations are
generally much easier to understand. And
that will again be the case here in this
theorem about the performance of hash
tables with chaning. So, let's apply this
three-step-decomposition principle to
complete the proof of the Carter-Wegman
theorem. So, for the record, let me just
remind you about the random variable that
we actually really care about, that's
Capital L. The reason that's a random
variable is that because it depends on the
choice of the hash function, little h.
This number could vary between zero and
something much, much bigger than zero,
depending on which each you choose. So,
this is complicated, hard to analyze
directly, so let's try to express it as
the sum of 0,1 random variables. So, here
are the0,1 random variables that are going
to be the constituents of Capital L. We're
going to have one such variable for each
object y in the data set. Now, remember
this is an unsuccessful search, x is not
in the data set Capital S. So, if y is in
the data set, x and y are necessarily
different. And we will define each random
variable z sub y, as follows. We'll define
it as one if y collides with x under h and
zero otherwise. So, for a given zy, we
have fixed objects x and y So, x is some
IP address, say, y is some distinct IP
address, x is not in our hash table, y is
in our hash table. And now, depending on
which hash function we wind up using,
these two distinct IP addresses may or may
not get mapped to the same bucket of our
hash table. So, this indicates a random
variable just indicating whether or not
they collide, whether or not we unluckily
choose a hash function little h that sends
these distinct IP addresses x and y to
exactly the same bucket. Okay, so, that's
zy, clearly by definition, it's a 0,1
random variable. Now, here's what's cool
about these random variables is that
Capital L, the list length that we care
about decomposes precisely into the sum of
the zy's. That is, we can write capital L
as being equal to the sum over the objects
in the hash table of zy. So, if you think
about it, this equation is always true, no
matter what the hash function h is. That
is if we choose some hash functions that
maps these IP address x to, say, bucket
number seventeen, Capital L is just
counting how many other objects in the
hash table wind up getting mapped to
bucket number seventeen. So, maybe ten
different ob jects got mapped to bucket
number seventeen. Those are exactly the
ten different values of y that will have
their zy equal to1, right? So, so l is
just counting the number of objects in the
data set s that's collide with x. A given
zy is just counting whether or not a given
object y in hash table is colliding with
x. So, summing over all the possible
things that could collide with x, summing
over the zy's, we of course get the total
number of things that collide with x which
is exactly equal to the number, the
population of x's bucket in the hash
table. Alright, so we've got all of our
ducks lined up in a row. Now, if we just
remember all of the things we have going
for us, we can just follow our nose and
nail the proof of this theorem. So, what
is it that we have going for us? Well, in
addition to this decomposition of the list
length in to indicate random variables,
we've got linear expectation going for us,
we've got the fact that our hash function
is drawn from a universal family going for
us. And we've got the fact that we've
chosen the number of buckets and to be
comparable to the data set size. So, we
want to use all of those assumptions and
finish the proof that the expected
performance is constant. So, we're going
to have a few inequalities and we're going
to begin with the thing that we really
care about. We care about the average list
length in x's bucket. Remember, we saw in
the previous slide, this is what governs
the expected performance of the lookup. If
we can prove that the expected value of
capital L is constant, we're done, we've
finished the theorem. So, the whole point
of this decomposition principle is to
apply linear of expectation which says
that the expected value of a sum of random
variables equals the sum of the expected
values. So, because L can be expressed as
the sum of these zy's, we can reverse the
summation and the expectation and we can
first sum over the y's, over the objects
in the hash table and then take the
expected value of zy. Now, something which
came up in our Quicksort an alysis but
which you might have forgotten is that 0,1
random variables have particularly simple
expectations. So, the next quiz is just
going to jog your memory about why 0,1
random variables are so nice in this
context. Okay, so the answer to this quiz
is the third one, the expected value of zy
is simply the probability that x and y
collide, that just follows from the
definition of the random variable zy and
the definition of expectation, namely
recall how do we define zy. This is just
this one, if this object y in the hash
table happens to collide with the object x
that we are looking for under the hash
function x and zero otherwise, again, this
will be, this will be one for some hash
functions and zero for other hash
functions. And then we just have to
compute expectations. So, one way to
compute the expected value of a 0,1 random
variable is, you just say, well, you know,
there are the cases where the random
variable evaluates to zero and then
there's the cases where the random
variable evaluates to one, and of course
we can cancel the zero. So, this just
equals the probability that zy = one. And
since zy being one is exactly the same
thing as x and y colliding, that's what
gives us the answer. Okay, so it's the
probability that x collides with y. So,
plenty of that into our derivation. Now,
we again have the sum of all the objects y
in our hash table and the set of the
expected value of zy what's right that in
the more interpretable form, the
probability that this particular object in
the hash table y collides with the thing
we are looking for x. Now, we know
something pretty cool about the
probability that a given pair of distinct
elements like x and y collide with each
other. What is it that we know? Okay, so I
hope you answered the second response to
this quiz. This is really in some sense
the key point of the analysis. This is the
role, that being a universal family of
hash functions plays in this performance
guarantee. What does it mean to be
universal? It means for any pair of
objects distinct like x and y in that
proof, if you make a random choice of a
hash function, the probability of
collision is as good as with perfectly
random hashing, hashing. Namely at most,
1/ n where n is the number of buckets. So,
now I can return to the derivation. What
that quiz reminds you is that the
definition of a universal family of hash
functions guarantees that this probability
for each y is at most 1/n, where n is the
number of buckets in the hash table. So,
let's just rewrite that. So, we've upper
bounded the expected list length by a sum
over the objects in the data set of 1/n.
And this, of course, is just equal to the
number of objects in the data set, the
[inaudible] of s divided by n. And what is
this? This is simply the load, this is the
definition of the load alpha which we are
assuming is constant. Remember, that was
the third caveat in the theorem. So,
that's why as long as you have a hash
function which you can compute quickly in
constant time. And as long as you keep the
load under control so the number of
buckets is commensurate with the size of
the data set that you're storing. That's
why, universal hash functions in a hash
table with chaining guarantee expected
constant time performance.

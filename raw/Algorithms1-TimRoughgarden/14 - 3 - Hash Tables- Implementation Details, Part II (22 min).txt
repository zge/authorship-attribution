Let's begin by building up some intuition
about what we would want from a hash
function, now that we know how hash
functions are usually implemented. So
let's start with a hash function which is
implemented by chaining. So what's going
to be the running time of our lookup,
insert, and delete operations in a hash
table with chaining? Well, the happy
operation in a hash table with chaining is
insertion. Insertion, we can just say
without any qualifications, is constant
time. This requires the sort of obvious
optimization that when you do insert, you
insert something at the front of the list
in its bucket. Like, there's no reason to
insert at the end. That would be silly. So
the plot thickens when we think about the
other two operations, deletion and the
lookup. So let's just think about lookup.
Deletion's basically the same. So how do
we implement lookup? Well, remember when
we get some key x, we invoke the hash
function. We call h(x). That tells us
what bucket to look in. So if it tells us
17, we know that, you know, x may
or may not be in the hash table. But at
this point we know that if it's in the
hash table, it's got to be in the linked
list that's in the seventeenth bucket. So
now we descend into this bucket. We find
ourselves a linked list. And now, we have
to resort to just an exhaustive search
through this list in the seventeenth
bucket, to see whether or not X is there.
So we know how long it takes to search a
regular list for some element. It's just
linear and the list length. And now we're
starting to see why the hash function
might matter. Right, so suppose we insert
100 objects into a hash table with 100
buckets. If we have a super lucky hash
function, then perhaps each bucket will
get its own object. There'll be one object
in each of the lists, in each of the
buckets, so. Theta of the list length
is just theta of one. We're doing great. Okay?
So, a constant, constant link to lists,
means constant time insert delete. A
really stupid hash function would map
every single object to bucket number
zero. Okay, so then if you insert 100
objects, they're all in bucket number
zero. The other 99 buckets are empty. And
so every time you do insert or delete,
it's just resorting to the naive linked list
solution. And the running time is
going to be linear and the number of
objects in the hash table. So the largest
list length could vary anywhere from m/n,
where m is the number of objects,
this is when you have equal linked lists,
to if you use this ridiculous constant
hash function, m, all the objects in the
same list. And so the main point I'm
trying to make here, is that you know,
first of all, at least with chaining,
where the running time is governed by the
list length, the running time depends
crucially on the hash function. How well
the hash function distributes the data
across the different buckets. And
something analogous is true for hash
tables that use open addressing. Alright
so here there aren't any lists. So you
don't, there's no linked lists to keep
track of. So the running time is going to
be governed by the length of the probe
sequence. So the question is how many
times do you have to look at different
buckets in the hash table before you
either find the thing you're looking for,
or if you're doing insertion, before you
find an empty bucket in which to insert
this new object. So the performance is
governed by the length of the probe
sequence. And again, the probe sequence is
going to depend on the hash function. For
really good hash functions in some sense,
stuff that spreads data out evenly, you
expect probe sequences to be not too bad.
At least intuitive, And for say the
constant function you are going to expect
these probe sequences to grow linearly
with the numbers of object you insert into
the table. So again this point remains
true, the performance of a hash table in
either implementation really depends on
what hash function you use. So, having
built up this intuition, we can now say
what it is what we want from a hash
function. So first we want it to lead to
good performance. I'm using the chaining
implementations as a guiding example. We
see that if we have a size of a hash
table, n, that's comparable to the number
of objects, m, it would be really cool if
all of the lists had a length that was
basically constant; therefore we had our
constant time operations. So equal length
lists is way better than unequal length
lists in a hash table with chaining. So
we, we want the hash function to do is to
spread the data out as equally as possible
amongst the different buckets. And
something similar is true with open
addressing; in some sense you want hash
functions to spread the data uniformly
across the possible places you might
probe, as much as possible. And in
hashing, usually the gold standard for
spreading data out is the performance of a
completely random function. So you can
imagine for each object that shows up you
flip some coins. With each of the n
buckets equally likely, you put this
object in one of the n buckets. And you
flip independent coins for every different
object. So this, you would expect, you
know, because you're just throwing darts
at the buckets independently, you'd expect
this to spread the data out quite well.
But, of course, it's not good enough just
to spread data out. It's also important
that we don't have to work too hard to
remember what our hash function is and to
evaluate it. Remember, every time we do
any of these operations, an insert or a
delete or a lookup, we're going to be
applying our hash function to some key x.
So every operation includes a hash
function evaluation. So if we want our
operations to run a constant time,
evaluating the hash function also better
run in constant time. And this second
property is why we can't actually
implement completely random hashing. So
there's no way we can actually adjust when
say we wanted to insert Alice's phone
number, flip a new batch of random coins.
Suppose we did. Suppose we flipped some
random coins and it tells us to put
Alice's phone number into the 39th
bucket, while. Later on, we might do a
lookup for Alice's phone number, and we
better remember the fact that we're
supposed to look in the 39th bucket for
Alice's phone number. But what does that
mean? That means we have to explicitly
remember what choice we made. We have to
write down. You get a list of effects that
Alice is in bucket number 39. In every
single insertion, if they're all from in
the point of coin flips, you have to
remember all of the different random
choices independently. And this really
just devolves back to the naive list base
solution that we discussed before. So,
evaluating the hash function is gonna take
us linear time and that defeats the
purpose of a hash table. So we again we
want the best of both worlds. We want a
hash function which we can store in
ideally constant space, evaluate in
constant time, but it should spread the
data out just as well as if we had this
gold standard of completely random
hashing. So I want to touch briefly on the
topic of how you might design hash
functions. And in particular good hash
functions that have the two properties we
identified on the previous slide. But I
have to warn you, if you ask ten
different, you know, serious hardcore
programmers, you know, about their
approach to designing hash functions,
you're likely to get ten somewhat
different answers. So the design of hash
functions is a tricky topic, and, it's as
much art as science at this point. Despite
the fact that there's a ton of science,
there's actually a very beautiful theory,
about what makes good hash functions. We'll
touch on a little bit of that in a, in a
different optional video. And if you only
remember one thing of, you know, from this
video or from these next couple slides,
the thing to remember is the following.
Remember that it's really easy to
inadvertently design bad hash functions
and bad hash functions lead to poor hash
table performance. Much poorer than you
would expect given the other discussion
we've had in this video. So if you have to
design your own hash function, do your
homework, get some examples, learn what
other experts are doing and use your best
judgment. If you do just something without
thinking about it, it's quite possible to
lead to quite poor performance, much
poorer than you were expecting. So to
drive home this point, suppose that you're
thinking about keys being phone numbers.
So let's say, you know, I'm gonna just be
very kinda United States centric here. I'm
just gonna focus on the, the ten digit
phone numbers inside the US. So the
universe size here is ten to the ten,
which is quite big. That's probably not
something you really want to implement
explicitly and let's consider an
application where, you know, you're only
say, keeping track of at most, you know,
100 or 1,000 phone numbers or something
like that. So we need to choose a number
of buckets, let's say we choose 1,000
buckets. Let's say we're expecting no more
than 500 phone numbers or so. So we double
that, we get a number of buckets to be
equal 1,000. And now I got to come up with
a hash function. And remember, you know, a
hash functions by definition. All it does
is map anything in the universe to a
bucket number. So that means it has to
take as input a ten digit phone number and
spit as output some number between zero
and 999. And, beyond that we have
flexibility of how to define this mapping.
Now, when you are dealing with things that
have all these digits it's very tempting
to just project on to a subset of the
digits. And, if you want a really terrible
hash function, just use the most
significant digits of a phone number to
define a mapping from phone numbers to
buckets. Alright, so I hope it's clear why
this is a terrible choice of a hash
function. Alright, so maybe you're a
company based in the San Francisco Bay
area. The area code for San Francisco is
415. So if you're storing phone numbers
from customers in your area. You know
maybe twenty, 30, 40 percent of them are
gonna have area codes 415. All of those
are going to hash to exactly the same
bucket, bucket number 415 in this hash
table. So you're gonna get an overwhelming
percentage of the data mapping just to
this one bucket. Meanwhile you know not
all 1000 possibilities of, of these three
digits are even legitimate area codes. Not
all three digit numbers are area codes in
the United States. So there'll be buckets
of your hash table which are totally
guaranteed to be empty. So you waste a ton
of space in your hash table, you have a
huge list in the bucket corresponding to
415, you have a huge list in the
bucket corresponding to 650, the area code
at Stanford. You're gonna have a very slow
look up time for everything that hashes to
those two buckets and there's gonna be a
lot of stuff that hashes to those two
buckets, So terrible idea. So a better but
still mediocre hash function would be to
do the same trick but using the last three
digits instead of the first three digits.
This is better than our terrible hash
function because there aren't ridiculous
clumps of phone numbers that have exactly
the same last three digits. But still,
this is sort of assuming you're using this
hash function as tantamount to thinking
that the last three digits of phone
numbers are uniformly distributed among
all of the 1,000 possibilities. And really
there's no evidence if that's true. Okay?
And so there's going to be patterns and
phone numbers that are maybe a little
subtle to see with the naked eye, but
which will be exposed if you try to use a
mediocre hash function like this. So let's
look at another example. Perhaps you are
keeping track of objects just based by
where they are laid out in memory. So in
other words the key for an object is just
gonna be its memory location and if these
things are in bytes, then you are
guaranteed that every memory location will
be a multiple of four. So for a second
example let's think about a universe where
the possible keys are the possible memory
locations, So here you're just associating
objects with where they're laid in memory,
and a hash function is responsible for
taking in as input some memory location of
some object and spitting out some bucket
number. Now generally, because of, you
know the structure of bytes and so on, our
memory locations are going to be multiples
of some power of two. In particular,
memory locations are going to be even, And
so a bad choice of a hash function. Would
be to take, remember, the hash function
takes the input of the memory location,
which is, you know, some possibly really
big number, and we wanna compress it, we
want to output a bucket number. Now let's
think of a hash table where we choose N
equals 10^3, or 1000 buckets.
So then the question is, you know, how is
this hash function going to take this big
number, which is the memory location, and
squeeze it down to a small number. Which
is one of the buckets and so let's just
use the same idea as in the mediocre hash
function, which is we're gonna look at the
least significant bits so we can express
that using the mod operator. So let's just
think about we pick the hash function h(x)
where h is the memory location to be x mod 1000
There again, you know, the
meaning of 1,000 is that's the number of
buckets we've chosen to put in our hash
table because, you know, we're gonna
remember roughly at most 500 different
objects. So don't forget what the mod
operation means, this means you just,
essentially subtract multiples of 1,000
until you get down to a number less than
1,000. So in this case, it means if you
write out x base ten, then you just take
the last three digits. So in that sense,
this is the same hash function as our
mediocre hash function when we were
talking about phone numbers. So we
discussed how the keys here are all going
to be memory locations; in particular
they'll be even numbers. And here we're
taking their modulus with respect to an
even number. And what does that mean? That
means every single output of this hash
function will itself be an even number.
Right, you take an even number, you
subtract a bunch of multiples of a 1000,
you're still going to have an even number.
So this hash function is incapable of
outputting an odd number. So what does
that mean? That means at least half of the
locations in the hash table will be
completely empty, guaranteed, no matter
what the keys you're hashing is. And
that's ridiculous. It's ridiculous to have
this hash table 50 percent of which is
guaranteed to be empty. And again, what I
want you to remember, hopefully long after
this class is completed is not so much
these specific examples, but more the
general point that I'm making. Which is,
it's really easy to design bad hash
functions. And bad hash functions lead to
hash table performance much poorer than
what you're probably counting on. Now that
we're equipped with examples of bad hash
functions. It's natural to ask about, you
know, what are some good hash functions?
Well it's actually quite tricky to answer
that question. What are the good hash
functions, and I'm not really going to
answer that on this slide. I don't promise
about hash functions that I'm going to
tell you about right now, are good in a
very strong sense of the word. I will say
these are not obliviously bad hash
functions, they're let's say, somewhat
better hash functions. And in particular
if you just need a hash function, and you
need a quick and dirty one, you don't want
to spend too much time on it. The method
that I'm going to talk about on this slide
is a common way of doing it. On the other
hand, if you're designing a hash function
for some really mission-critical code, you
should learn more than what I'm gonna tell
you about on this slide. So you, you
should do more research about what are the
best hash functions, what's the state of
the art, if you have a super important
hash function. But if you just need a
quick one what's, what we say on this
slide will do in many, in most situations.
So the design of a hash function can be
thought of as two separate parts. So
remember by definition a hash function
takes as input something from the
universe. An IP address, a name, whatever
and spits out a bucket number. But, it can
be useful to factor that into two separate
parts. So first you take an object which
is not intrinsically numeric. So,
something like s string or something more
abstract. And you somehow turn an object
into a number, possibly a very big number. And then you take a possibly big number and you map it to a much smaller number,
namely the index of a bucket. So in some
cases I've seen these two steps given the
names like the first step is formulating
the hash code For an object, and then the
second step is applying a compression
function. In some cases, you can skip the
first step. So, for example, if your keys
are social security numbers, they're
already integers. If they're phone number,
they're already integers. Of course, there
are applications where the objects are not
numeric. You know, for example, maybe
they're strings, maybe you're remembering
names. And so then, the production of this
hash code basically boils down to writing
a subroutine that takes, as input, a
string, and outputs some possibly very big
number. There are standard methods for
doing that, it's easy to find resources
to, to give you example code for
converting strings to integers you know,
I'll just say one or two sentences about
it. So you know each character in a string
it is easy to regard as a number in
various ways. Either you know just say it
is ASCII, well ASCII code then you just
have to aggregate all of the different
numbers, one number per character into
some overall number and so one thing you
can do is you can iterate over the
characters one at a time. You can keep a
running sum. And with each character, you
can multiply the running sum by some
constant, and then add the new letter to
it, and then, if you need to, take a
module list to prevent overflow. And the
point of me giving you this one to two
sentence of the subroutine is just to give
you a flavor of what they're like, and to
make sure th at you're just not scared of
it at all. Okay? So it's very simple
programs you can write for doing things
like converting from strings to integers.
But again, you know, I do encourage you to
look it up on the Web or in a programming
textbook, to actually look at those
examples. Okay? But there are standard
methods for doing it. So that leaves the
quest, question of how to design this
compression function. So you take as input
this huge integer. Maybe your keys are
already numeric, like Social Security
numbers or IP addresses. Or maybe you've
already some subroutine to convert a
string, like your friend's name, into.
Some big number, but the point is you have
a number in the millions or the billions,
and you need to somehow take that and
output one of these buckets. And again
think of there being maybe a thousand or
so buckets. So the easiest way to do that
is something we already saw in a previous
slide, which is just to take the modulus,
With respect to the number of buckets. Now
certainly one positive thing you can say
about this compression function is its
super simple, Both in the sense that it's
simple to code and in the sense that it's
simple to evaluate. Now remember that was
our second goal for a hash function. It
should be simple to store, it is actually
nothing to store. And it should be quick
to evaluate. And this certainly fits the
bill. Now the problem is, remember the
first. Property of a hash function that we
wanted is that it should spread the data
out equally. And what we saw in the
previous slide is that at least if you
choose the number of buckets N poorly,
then you can fail to have the first
property. And in that respect you can fail
to be a good hash function. So if for
example if N is even and all of your
objects are even, then it's a disaster,
all of the odd buckets go completely
empty. And honestly, you know, this is a
pretty simplistic method. Like I said,
this is a quick and dirty hash function.
So, no matter how you choose the number of
buckets N, it's not gonna be a perfect
hash function in any sense of the word.
That said, there are some rules of thumb
for how to pick the number of buckets, how
to pick this modulus, so that you don't
get the problems that we saw on the
previous slide. So, I'll conclude this
video just with some standard rules of
thumb. You know, if you just need a quick
and dirty hash function, you're gonna use
the, the modulus compression function, how
do you choose N? Well, the first thing is
we definitely don't want to have the
problem we had in the last slide, where
we're guaranteed to have these empty
buckets no matter what the data is. So
what went wrong in the previous slide?
Well. The problem is that all of the data
elements were divisible by two. And the
hash function modulus, the number of
buckets, was also divisible by two. So
because they shared a common factor,
namely two, that guaranteed that all of
the odd buckets remained empty. And this
is a problem, more generally, if the data
shares any common factors with N, the
number of buckets. So, in other words, if
all of your data elements are multiples of
three, and the number of buckets is also a
multiple of three, you got a big problem.
Then everything's gonna hash into bucket
numbers which are multiples of three, too,
that's if your hash table will go
unfilled. So the upshot is, you really
want the number of buckets to not share
any factors With the data that you're
hashing. So, how do you reduce the number
of common factors? Well, you just make
sure the number of buckets has very few
factors, which means you should choose N
to be a prime number, 'kay? A number that
has no nontrivial factors, And let me
remind you, the number of buckets should
also be comparable to the size of the set
that you're planning on storing. Again, at
no point did we need "N" to be, you know,
very closely connected to the number of
elements that you're storing just within,
say some small constant factor. And you
can always find a prime within a small
constant factor of a target number of
elements to store. If the number of
buckets in your hash table isn't too big,
if it's just in say the thousands or maybe
the tens of thousands, then, you know, you
can just look up a list of all known
primes up to some point, and you can just
sort of pick out a prime which is about
the magnitude that you're looking for. If
you're gonna use a really huge number of
buckets in the millions or more, then
there are algorithms you can use for
primarily testing which will help you find
a prime in about the range that you're
looking for. >> So that's the first order
rule of thumb you should remember if
you're using the modulus compression
function, which is set the number of
buckets equal to a prime. So you're
guaranteed to not have non-trivial common
factors of the modulus shared by all of
your data. So there's also a couple of
second order optimizations, which people
often mention. And you also don't want the
prime; you want the prime to be not too
close to patterns in your data. So what
does that mean, Patterns in your data?
Well, in the phone number example we saw
that patterns emerged in the data when we
expressed it base ten. So for example,
there is crazy amounts of Lumping in the
first three digits when we expressed a
phone number-based ten, Because that
corresponded with the area code. And then,
with. Memory locations when we express,
express it base two, there are crazy
correlations in the low orbits. And these
are the two most common examples. Either
there's some digit, to the base ten
representation or digits in the base two
representation where you have, you know,
patterns that is non-uniformity. So that.
Suggests that the prime, that, N that you
choose, you know, all else being equal,
shouldn't be too close to a power of two,
and shouldn't be too close to a power of
ten. The thinking being that, that will
spread more evenly data sets that do have
these patterns in terms of base two
representation, or base ten
representations. So in closing, this is a
recipe I recommend for coding of hash
functions if what you're looking to do is
sort of minimize program ming, programmer
time, subject to not coming up with a hash
function, which is completely broken. But
I want to reiterate, this is not the state
of the art in hash function design. There
are hash functions which are in some sense
better than the ones that expand on this
slide. If you're responsible for some
really mission critical code that involves
a hash function, you should really study
more deeply than we've been able to do
here. We'll touch on some issues in, of
the different optional video, but really
you should do additional homework. You
should find out about the state-of-the-art
about hash function design. You should
also look into implementations of open
addressing in those probing strategies.
And above all you really should consider
cold, coding up multiple prototypes and
seeing which one works the best. There's
no silver bullet, there's no panacea in
the design of hash tables. I've given you
some high-level guidance about the
different approaches. But ultimately it's
gonna be up to you to find the optimal
implementation for your own application.

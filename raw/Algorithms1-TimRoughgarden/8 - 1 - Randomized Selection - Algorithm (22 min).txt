I said pretty much everything I wanna say
about sorting at this point but I do wanna
cover one more related topic, namely the
selection problem. This is a problem of
computing order statistics of an array.
With computing the median of an array
being a special case. Analogous to our
coverage of quick sort the goal is going
to be the design and analysis of a super
practical randomized algorithm that solves
the problem. And this time we'll even
achieve an expected running time that is
linear in the length of the input array.
That is bigger of N for input array of
length N as supposed to the O of N login
time that we had for the expected running
time of quick sort. Like quick sort the
[inaudible]. Our analysis is also going to
be, quite elegant. So in addition these
two required video's on this very
practical algorithm will motivate two
optional video's that are on very cool
topics but of a similar more theoretical
nature. The first optional video is going
to be on how you solve the selection
problem in deterministic linear time. That
is without using randomization. And the
second optional video will be a sorting
lower bound. That is why no comparison
[inaudible] sort can be better than
merSort. Can have better running time.
[inaudible] and login. So a few words
about what you should have fresh in your
mind before you watch this video. I'm
definitely assuming that you've watched
the quick sort videos. And not just
watched them, but that you have that
material pretty fresh in your mind. So in
particular the video of quick sort about
the partition subroutine, so this is where
you take an input array, you choose a
pivot, and you do by repeated swaps. You
rearrange the array so that everything
less than the pivot's to the left of it,
everything bigger than the pivot is to the
right of it. You should remember that
sub-routine. You should also remember the
previous discussion about pivot choices,
the idea that the quality of a pivot
depends on how balanced a split into two
different sub-problems it gives you. Those
are both going to be important. For the
analysis of this randomized linear time
selection algorithm, I need you to be,
remember the concepts from probability
review part one, in particular, random
variables, their expectation, and
linearity of expectation. That said let?s
move on and formally define what the
selection problem is. The input is the
same as for the sorting problem; just
you're given an array. Of indistinct
entries [sound]. But in addition, you're
told what order statistic you're looking
for. So that's gonna be a number I, which
is an integer between one and n. And the
goal is to output just a single number,
mainly the I-th order statistic. That is
the I-th smallest entry in this input
array. So just to be clear, we have an
array entry of, let's just, say four
elements. Continue the numbers ten, eight,
two, and four, and you were looking for
say the third or statistic, that would be
this eight. The first order statistic is
just the minimum elent, element of the
array. That's easy to find with a linear
scan. The Nth order statistic is just the
maximum. Again easier, easy to find with a
linear scan. The middle element is the
median and you should think of that as the
canonical version of the selection
problem. Now, when n is odd, it's obvious
what the median is. That's just the middle
element, so the n + one over 2-th order
statistic. If the array has even link,
there's two possible mediums, so let's
just take the smaller of them. That's the
end over truth order statistic. You might
wonder why you'd ever want to compute the
median of an array rather than the mean,
that is, the average. It's easier to see
that you can compute the average with a
simple linear scan. And the median you
can, one motivation is it's a more robust
version of the mean. So if you just have a
data entry problem and it corrupts one
element of an input array, it can totally
screw up the average value of the array.
But it has generally very little impact on
the median. A final comment about the
problem is I am going to assume that the
array entries are distinct. That is,
there's no repeated elements. But just
like in our discussions of sorting, this
is not a big assumption. I can encourage
you to think about how to adapt these
algorithms to work even if the arrays do
have duplicates. You can indeed still get
the same very practical, very fast
algorithms with duplicate elements. Now,
if you think about it, we already have a
pretty darn good algorithm that solves the
selection problem. Here's the algorithm,
its two simple steps and it runs in O of N
login time. Step one, sort the input
array. We have various subroutines to do
that. Let's say we pick merge sort. Now
what is it we're trying to do? We're
trying to find the Ith smallest element in
the input array. Well, once we've sorted
it, we certainly know where the Ith
smallest element is. It's in the Ith
position of the sorted array. So that's
pretty cool. We've just done what a
computer scientist would call a reduction,
and that's a super useful and super
fundamental concept. It's when you realize
that you can solve one problem. By
reducing it to another problem that you
already know how to solve. So what we just
showed is that the selection problem
reduces easily to the sorting problem. We
already know how to solve the sorting
problem N log N time, so that gives us an
N log N time solution to the selection
problem. But, again, remember the mantra
of any algorithm designer worth their salt
is can we do better. We should avoid
continents. Just because we got N log N
doesn't mean we can stop there. Maybe we
can be even faster. Now certainly we gonna
have to look at all the elements in the
input array in the worst case. We
shouldn't expect to do better than linear,
but, Hey Why not linear time? Actually, if
you think about it, we probably should
have asked that question back when we were
studying the sorting problem. Why were we
so content with the N log N time bound for
Merge Short? And the O of N log N time on
average bound for Quick Sort. Well, it
turns out we have a really good reason to
be happy with our N log N upper bounds for
the sorted problem. It turns out, and this
is not obvious, and will be the subject of
an optional video. You actually can't sort
an input array of length N better than N
log N time. Either in the worse case, or
on average. So, in other words, if we
insist on solving the selection problem
via a reduction to the sorting problem
then we're stuck with this n log n time
amount. Okay, strictly speaking that's for
something called comparison sorts; see the
video for more details. But the upshot is
if we want a general purpose algorithm and
we wanna do better than n log n for
selection, we have to do it using
ingenuity beyond this reduction. We have
to prove that selection is a strictly
easier problem. Then sort it. That's the
only way we're gonna have an algorithm
that beats n log n. It's the only way we
can conceivably get a linear time
algorithm. And, that is exactly what is up
next on our plates. We're going to show
selection is indeed fundamentally easier
than sorting. We can have a linear time
algorithm for it, even though we can't get
a linear time algorithm for sorting. You
can think of the algorithm we're gonna
discuss as a modification of quick sort,
and in the same spirit of quick sort, it
will be a randomized algorithm, and the
running time will be an expected running
time that will hold for any input array.
Now, for the sorting problem, we know that
quick sort, that n log n time on average
for the average is over the coin flips
done by the code. But we also know that if
we wanted to we could get a sorting
algorithm in n log n time that doesn't use
randomization. The merge sort algorithm is
one such solution. So, if you were giving
a liner time solution for a selection for
finding order statistics that uses
randomization. And we'd be natural to
wonder is there an analog to merge sort?
Is there an algorithm which does not use
randomization and gets this exact same
linear time [inaudible]? In fact, there
is. The algorithm's a little more
complicated and there. For not quite as
practical as this randomize algorithm.
But, it's still very cool. It's a really
fun algorithm to learn and to teach. So, I
will have an optional video about linear
time selection without randomization. So,
for those of you who aren't gonna watch
that video or wanna know what's the key
idea the idea is to choose the pivots
deterministically in a very careful way
using a trick called the median of
medians. That's all I'm gonna say about it
now. You should watch the optional video
if you want more details. I do feel
compelled to warn you that if you're going
to actually implement a selection
algorithm, you should do the one that we
discuss in this video and not the linear
time one because the one we'll discuss in
this video has both smaller constants and
works in place. So, what I want to do next
is develop the idea that we can modify the
quick sort paradigm in order to directly
solve the selection problem. So, to get an
idea of how that works, let me review the
partition subroutine. Like in quick sort.
This subroutine will be our workhorse for
the selection algorithm. So what the
partition subroutine does is it takes and
inputs some jumbled up array and it's
going to. Solve a problem which is much
more modest than sorting. So, in
partitioning, it's going to first choose a
pivot element, somehow. We'll have to
discuss what's a good strategy for
choosing a pivot element. But suppose, you
know, in this particular input array, it
chooses the first element, this three, as
the pivot element. The responsibility of
the partition subroutine, then, is to
rearrange the elements in this array so
that the following properties are
satisfied. Anything less than the pivot is
to the left of it. It can be in jumbled
order but if you're less than the pivot,
you'd better be to the left like this two
and one is less than the three. If you're
bigger than the pivot, then again you can
be in jumbled order amongst those elements
but all of them have to be to the right of
the pivot, and that's true for the numbers
four through eight, they all are to the
right of the pivot three in a jumbled
order. So this in particular puts the
pivot in its rightful position where we
belong in the final sorted array and at
least for quick sort, it enabled. Us to
recursively sort to smaller sub problems,
so this is where I want you to think a
little bit about how we should adapt this
paradigm. So supposed I told you the first
step of our selection algorithm is going
to be to choose a pivot and partition the
array, now the question is. How are we
going to recurs? We need to understand how
to find the Ith order statistic of the
original input array. It suffices to
recurs on just one sub problem. Of smaller
size. And find a suitable order statistic
in it. So how should we do that? Let me
ask you that in, with some very concrete
examples, about what pivot we'd choose,
and what order statistic we're looking
for, and see what you think. So the
correct answer to this quiz is the second
answer. So we can get away with recursing
just once, and in this particular example
we're going to recurs on the right side of
the array. And instead of looking for the
fifth order statistic like we were
originally. We're going to recursively
search for the second order statistic. So,
why is that? Well, first, why do we recurs
on the right side of the array? So, by
assumption we have an array with ten
elements. We choose the pivot, we do
partitioning. Remember the pivot winds up
in its rightful positioning. That's what
partioning does. So, if the pivot winds up
in the third position, we know it's the
third smallest element in the array. Now
that's not what we were looking for. We
were looking for the fifth smallest
element in the array. That of course is
bigger. Than the third smallest element of
the array, so by partitioning, where is
the fifth element gonna be, it's gotta be
to the right, of this third smallest
element, to the right of the pivot, so we
know for sure. That the fifth order
statistic of the original array lies to
the right of the pivot. That is
guaranteed. So we know where to recurs on
the right-hand side. Now. What are we
looking for? We are no longer looking for
the fifth order statistic, the fifth
smallest element. Why? Well, we've thrown
out both the pivot, and everything smaller
than it. Remember, we're only recursing on
the right hand side. So we've thrown out
the pivot, the third element, and
everything less that it. The minimum and
the second minimum. Having deleted the
three smallest elements, and originally
looking for the fifth smallest of what
remains of what we're recursing on. We're
looking for the second smallest element.
So, the selection algorithm, in general,
is just the generalization of this idea,
so arbitrary arrays. And arbitrary
situations of whether the pivot comes
back, equal to less than or bigger than
the element you're looking for. So let me
be more precise. I'm gonna call this
algorithm R select for randomize
selection. And according to the problem
definition it takes as input as usual an
array A of some length N. But then also
the order statistic that we're
looking for. So we're gonna call that I.
And of course we assume that I is some
integer between one and N inclusive. So
for the base case that's gonna be if the
array has size one. Then the only element
we could be looking for is the one quarter
statistic and we just return the sole
element of the array. Now we have to
partition the array around the pivot
element. And just like in quick sort we're
not going to be, we're going to be very
lazy about choosing the pivot. We're gonna
choose it uniformly at random from the
[inaudible] possibilities and hope things
work out. And that'll be the crups of the
analysis proving that random pivots are
good enough sufficiently often. Having
chosen the pivot we now just invoke that
standard partitioning sub routine. As
usually that's gonna give us the
partition's array. You'll have the pivot
element. You'll have everything less than
the pivot to the left, everything bigger
than the pivot to the right. As usual,
I'll call everything to the left the first
parts of the partitioned array. Everything
bigger the second part. Now we have a
couple of cases, depending on whether the
pivot is bigger or less than the element
we're looking for. So I need [inaudible]
notation to, to talk about that. So let's
let J be, the ordered statistic that P is.
So if P winds up being the third smallest
element, like in the quiz, then J's gonna
be equal to three. Equivalently, we can
think of J as defined as the position of
the pivot in the partitioned version of
the array. Now there's one case which is
very unlikely to occur but we should
include it just for completeness. If we're
really lucky then in fact our random pivot
just happens to be the older statistic we
were looking for. That's when I equals J.
We're looking for I's smallest element if
by dumb luck the pivot winds up being I's
smallest element, we're done. We can just
return it we don't have to recurs. Now in
general of course, we don't randomly
choose the element we're looking for. We
choose something that well, it could be
bigger or could be smaller than it. In the
quiz, we chose a pivot that was smaller
than what we're looking for. Actually,
that's the harder case. So let's first
start with a case where the pivot winds up
being bigger than the element we're
looking for. So that means that J is
bigger than I. We're looking for the Ith
smallest. We randomly chose the Jth
smallest for J bigger than I. So this is
opposite case of the quiz. This is where
we know what we're looking for has to be
to the left of the pivot. The pivot's the
J smallest. Everything less than it is to
the left. We're looking for the I
smallest. I is less than J, so that's
gotta be on the left. That's where we
recurs. Moreover, it's clear we're looking
for exactly the same order statistic. If
we're looking for the third smallest
element, we're only throwing out stuff
which is bigger than something even bigger
than the third smallest element. So we're
still looking for the third smallest of
what remains. And naturally the new array
size is J minus one, because that's what's
is to the left of the pivot. Is when the
random element that we choose is less than
what we are looking for and then we're
just like the quiz. So namely what we are
looking for is bigger than the pivot, it's
got to be on the right hand side, we know
we've got recurs on the right hand side.
Into the right hand side has n-j elements
we threw out everything up to the pivots.
We threw out J things that's n-j left and
of all of the j things we threw out are
less than what we are looking for. So what
we use to be looking for is I's smallest
element now we are looking for the I-J's
smallest element. So that is the whole
algorithm. That is how we adopt the
approach we took toward the sorting
problem in Quick Sort, and adapt it to the
problem of selection. So, is this
algorithm any good? Let's start studying
its properties, and understand how well it
works. So let's begin with correctness. So
the claim is that, no matter how the
algorithm's coin flips come up, no matter
what random pivots we choose, the
algorithm is correct, in the sense that
it's guaranteed to output the [inaudible]
order statistic. The proof is by
induction. It precedes very similarly to
Quick Sort, so I'm not gonna give it here.
If you're curious about how these proofs
go, there's an optional video about the
correctness of Quick Sort. If you watch
that and understand it, it should be clear
how to adapt that inductive argument, to
apply to this selection algorithm as well.
So as usual for divide-and-conquer
algorithms, the interesting part is not so
much knowing, understanding why the
algorithm works, but rather understanding
how fast it runs. So the big question is,
what is the running time of this selection
algorithm? Now to understand this, we have
to understand the ramifications of pivot
choices on the running time. So, you've
seen the Quick Sort videos, they're fresh
in your mind. So what should be clear is
that, just like in Quick Sort, how fast is
algorithm one is going to depend on how
good the pivots are, and what good pivots
means is pivots that guarantee a balanced
split. So in the next quiz, we'll make
sure that you understand this point, and
ask you to think about just how bad this
selection algorithm could be if you get
extremely unlucky in your pivot choices.
So the correct answer to this question is
exactly the same as the answer for Quick
Sort. The worst case running time, if the
pivots are chosen, just, in a really
unlucky way, is actually quadratic in the
array length. Remember, we're
shooting for linear time. So this
quadratic is a total disaster. So how
could this happen? Well, suppose you're
looking for the median. And suppose you
choose the minimum element as the pivot
every single time. So if this is what
happens if every time you choose the pivot
to be the minimum, just like in quick sort
this means every time you recurce all you
succeed doing is peeling off a single
element from the inputt array, now you're
not going to find the medium element until
you've done roughly N over two recursive calls, each on an array that has size at
least a constant fraction of the original
one, so that it's a linear number of
recursive calls, each on an array of size
at least some constant times N, so that
gives you a total running time of
quadratic overall. Of course, this is an
absurdly unlikely event. Frankly, your
computer is more likely to be struck by a
meteor than it is for the pivot to be
chosen as the minimum element in every
recursive call. But, if you really had an
absolutely worst case choice of pivots, it
would give this quadratic run time bound.
So the upshot then is that the running
time of this randomized selection
algorithm depends on how good our pivots
are and for worst case choice of pivots,
the running time can be as large as
N-squared. Now hopefully, most of the time
we're gonna have much better pivots and so
the analysis proceeds on making that idea
precise. So the key to a fast running time
is going to be the, the usual property
that we want to see in divide and conquer
algorithms. Mainly every time recourse,
every time they recourse, the problem size
better not just be smaller, but it better
be smaller by a significant factor. How
would that happen in this selection
approach based on the partition
subroutine; well if both of the sub
problems are not too big, then we're
guaranteed that when we recourse we make a
lot of progress. So let's think about what
the best possible pivot would be in the
sense of giving a balanced split. Right?
So, of course, in some sense the best
pivot is you just choose the order
statistic you're looking for and that,
then you're done in constant time but
that's extremely unlikely and it's not
worth worrying about. So ignore the fact
that we might guess the pivot. What's the
best pivot if we want to guarantee an
aggressive decrease in the input size
before the next generation. Well, the best
pivot's the one that gives us as most
balanced split as possible. So what's the
pivot that gives us the most balanced
split, a 50-50 split? Well, if you think
about it, it's exactly the median. Of
course, this is not super helpful, because
the median might well be what we're
looking for in the first place. So this
is, sort of, a circular idea. But for
intuition, it's still worth exploring what
kind of running time we would get in the
best case, right. If we're not going to
get linear time even in this magical best
case, we certainly wouldn't expect to get
it on average over random choices of the
pivots. So what would happen if we
actually did luckily choose the median as
the pivot every single time? Well, we get
the recurrence that the running time that
the algorithm requires on an array of
length N. Well, there's only gonna be one
recursive call. So this is the big
difference from Quick Sort, where we had
to recurs on both sides, and we had two
recursive calls. So here, we're gonna have
only one recursive call. In the magical
case where our pivots are always equal to
the median, both sub problems sizes
contain, are only half as large as the
original one. So when we recurs, it's not
a problem size guaranteed to be, at most,
N over two. And then outside the recursive
call, pretty much all we do is a
partitioning indication. And we know that
that's linear time. So the. Recurrence we
get is T of n is at most T of n over two,
plus big O of n. This is totally ready to
get plugged into the master method. It
winds up being case two of the master
method. And indeed, we get exactly what we
wanted, linear time. To reiterate, this is
not interesting in its own right, this is
just for intuition. This was a sanity
check that, at least for a best case
choice of pivots, we'd get what we want, a
linear time algorithm, and we do. Now the
question is, how well do we do with random
pivots? Now the intuition, the hope is
exactly as it was for Quick sort, which is
that random pivots are perfectly good
surrogates for the median, the perfect
pivot. So having the analysis of Quick
sort under our belt we're indeed random
pivot do approximate very closely with the
performance you'll get with best case
pivots. Maybe, now we have reason to
believe this is hopefully true. That said
as a mathematical statement this is
totally not obvious and it's going to take
proof, that's the next subject for next
video. But let me just be clear exactly
what we're claiming. Here is the running
time guaranteed the randomized selection
provides. For an arbitrary input array of
length N, the average running time of this
randomized collection algorithm is linear,
Big O of N. Let me reiterate a couple
points I made for the analogous guarantee
for the Quick sort algorithm. The first is
that, we're making no assumptions about
the data whatsoever, in particular we're
not assuming that the data is random. This
guarantee holds not matter what input
array that you feed into this randomized
algorithm, in that sense this is a totally
general purpose subroutine. So, where then
does this averaging come from? Where does
the expectation come from? The randomness
is not in the data, rather the randomness
is in the code and we put it there
ourselves. Now let's proceed to the
analysis.

Oh, oh hi, sorry. 
I was in, I was in the forums. 
[SOUND] I guess it's time for this weeks 
video. 
So this week we're moving from history to 
technology. 
And in a sense were going to tell the 
same story again. 
you know, we'll sort of start from the 
beginning, but we're going to start from 
the bottom and move upwards so it sounds 
as though we're kind of taking about the 
same things, but just from a more 
technical perspective. 
Don't worry, you'll be fine. 
we're not going to over, there's no math, 
I promise, there's no programming. 
Don't worry about that. 
So of course, I appreciate IEEE Computer 
Magazine, who I write for to let me use 
the articles that are associated with 
some of the videos, as well as the folks 
from up in Michigan who have helped me, 
so. 
Hang on a sec. 
Now hang on, I've got a phone call. 
I'll be right back. 
Okay, well that's been sent. 
Sorry for that interruption. 
again I thank everybody for the use of 
the copyright materials. 
part of my hidden agenda in this class is 
that you will be able to look at this 
XKCD comic and you'll understand the 
humor. 
So, I'm going to stop for a moment and 
let you look at it and see if you get the 
humor. 
Okay so maybe you did, maybe you didn't. 
But hopefully by the time we're done, 
you'll have a better chance of getting 
here. 
So if you recall, the most academics 
throughout the 60s 70s and 80s. 
The best they had access to was this 
store and forward networking where you 
would send a message and it would go into 
a computer and it might sit for some 
time. 
Then it would find its way across a 
network and it would sit for a little 
while longer. 
Find, and, and hop, and there are these 
multiple hops. 
We call these hops, and each of these 
would be a couple hundred miles perhaps. 
And to go from say Michigan to Stanford, 
there might be fifteen or twenty hops. 
Hops are as much, defined by geography 
where we're all trying to optimized the 
cost of these long distance connections. 
So the thing that really characterized 
store and forward networking was that 
there wasn't a lot of sharing. 
One message was being sent across one of 
these links at a time and all the other 
messages just kind of waited in time, in 
line. 
Now, that the, the, the innovation that 
happened in the research networks in the 
60's through the 80's ultimately unbodied 
in the ARPAnet was the fact that they 
were going to be packet networks. 
First, how do we share one link, so that 
a long message doesn't clog it up? 
And how do we deal with outages more 
dynamically? 
With the idea that, eventually, you could 
send a packet across the country. 
And back into a computer and back out in 
maybe a half of a second. 
And that was seen as something to do 
rather than. 
Somewhere between ten minutes and a day 
or two. 
So how to do this efficiently. 
It was a research project. 
And it was a research project that lasted 
almost 20 year-, well, 20 years. 
And, 20 or more years. 
And, and it, one of the neatest things 
about this is they were able to throw it 
away and rewrite it a bunch of times. 
So that they could put something in 
production, see its flaws, see what was 
good about it, and they had the money 
from Darpa to throw it away and rewrite 
it. 
Now by the late 1970s it had 100ish 
computers on it, here's a picture, and 
these are not the schools, these are the 
computers, these are. 
You know, listing all of the computers 
that are there. 
And so the engine, the, the innovation 
that they spent 20 years perfecting, was 
the notion of packet-switching. 
So how can we simply move data 
simultaneously across the connection? 
And the essential brilliant idea Is break 
the message into packets. 
And again to sort of review, here I have 
a message and I have post cards that only 
can handle 10 characters. 
And i'm going to send this "Hello there 
have a nice day" message to Daphne in 
California. 
And so I have 3 10 character post cards. 
I basically put a from address and a to 
address on each postcard and a sequence 
number on each postcard, 1, 2 and 3, and 
I put ten characters on each and I stick 
them in my mailbox. 
I just put them in. 
Put the sign up and then I wait. 
Now let's just say you know, that the 
post office person comes and picks this 
first one up and it goes to Chicago from 
Michigan than it goes to Omaha then it 
goes to Denver then the second one kind 
of falls on the floor and it ends up 
going to Charlotte North Carolina. 
And then they're like, Why is this here? 
And then they send it to Atlanta to get 
checked. 
And then they make sure. 
And, and this one goes and. 
And Number 3 ends up going to St. 
Louis. 
And then Tulsa. 
And then Colorado. 
And this one gets routed back to 
Charlotte because they weren't sure why 
they sent it to them in the first place. 
And then they send it to Memphis, 
Tennessee and then this one makes it to 
California. 
And this other one sort of goes to 
Phoenix and this one finally gets to 
Dallas, Texas. 
And this other one goes finally. 
And the third one goes to Tucson, 
Arizona, then Las Vegas Nevada and 
finally he makes it. 
So, these poor little postcards I put in 
They have each a different journey. 
Right? 
It's a little adventure for each of the 
postcards that they go through. 
And, so, we don't, I don't see how this 
works on my end. 
I put in three postcards. 
I numbered them, one, two, three. 
But on the far end, in California, Daphne 
opens her mailbox. 
And has scribbling all over her mailbox. 
Oh, the shame! 
No, actually we'll get rid of the 
scribbling. 
So Daphne opens up her mailbox, and she 
doesn't know how these packets got there, 
I mean, postcards, how they got there, 
out comes the first one. 
She goes, oh looks like I just got a 
message from Chuck, but I only got part 
of it. 
Then out comes the second one shortly 
thereafter. 
Then after a long period of time, finally 
the third one comes out, but it's 
actually the second one. 
And now she understands that she's got 
the entire message, and she reassembles 
it, and away we go. 
And so this is the basic notion of how 
all those postcards can share the 
infrastructure. 
All, they can all be invited at the same 
time. 
They can take different paths. 
You don't have to connect them all 
together like trains, basically. 
and, and this led to a shared network 
infrastructure. 
And so the computers that were in a store 
and forward network, went from, sort of, 
big powerful computers with disk drives 
to really tiny computers with a single 
purpose of forwarding packets. 
Rather than longs term storage of 
message. 
And so, so the, the store in forward had, 
longs term storage of messages, in the 
routers. 
So the, but, I mean, not in the routers. 
In long, in the store in forward, the old 
one, long term storage was somewhere in 
the network. 
But this is only short term, right, 
short-term storage, short-term storage. 
And so when a packet comes out, it simply 
has to find its way through a series of 
hops. 
It still hops and it's still connections, 
but basically it has to find its way 
across the Internet. 
And then we would take whole campuses 
Like University of Michigan, say, or 
Stanford for example. 
And, then we'd have sort of various kinds 
of local networks on those campuses, and 
computers on the campuses, and servers 
and various things. 
And they would route all their packets, 
all their data out to the Internet, and 
then the packets would find their way 
across the Internet, and then we might 
have a home connection as well that might 
connect. 
And so, the shared, shared Network 
infrastructure focuses only on packets, 
not reliability or anything else. 
[COUGH] So, this notion of hops didn't go 
away. 
As a matter of fact, I don't know how 
many hops it took to get from Ann Arbor 
to Palo Alto in using BITNET. 
I'm going to guess it might have been 16 
or 20, in these days it takes 16 or 20 
hops. 
The difference is in the internet, the 16 
or 20 hops happens in a hundredth of a 
second, or a tenth of a second. 
So the ho-, notion of hops, and the 
notion of intermediate computers is still 
present in the internet, and the TCPIP 
networks that we use today. 
And so your, your, your message sort of 
leaves you the host that you're in, hops 
to the first router, and then hops to 
however many routers. 
Dot dot dot, this is more of a dot dot 
dot thing. 
And then finally hops its way out to the 
far host. 
And so this is sort of either your 
computer, maybe Stanford's web server, 
and then there's this series of routers 
in the middle that it hops through. 
Okay? 
And so, the problem of what data goes 
between here and here is you gotta solve 
a lot of problems, right? 
How to, all, all kinds of problems, and 
so, in order to simplify the solution or 
break the solution into simpler, more 
manageable parts. 
They came up with a layered network 
model. 
Now this is a cartoon and computer people 
love drawing cartoons and saying this is 
our architecture. 
This is our frame work. 
This is our approach. 
Sometimes they're helpful. 
Sometimes they're not helpful. 
Sometimes the cartoon is just kind of a 
cartoon. 
But what's usually being communicated in 
these kinds of pictures is they're taking 
a big problem and breaking it down into 
some subset, some set of smaller 
problems. 
So, the whole problem they've gotta solve 
of getting data reliability reliably 
across the whole country is that big and 
if we can break into four pieces. 
And work separately and come up with ways 
to let these pieces interact, work 
separately with each onem then maybe 
we'll have a better solution, okay? 
So take a problem that's so large and so 
complex that we might not be able to 
solve it and break it into four smaller 
problems Gives us a better chance of 
solving the four problems. 
Now, there's a certain art to picking how 
you break the problem up. 
And there's more than one network model. 
The one that we use in the Internet is 
the TCP/IP or the Internet Protocol Suite 
model, and we'll meet some of the people 
who designed that. 
there was also a model called the 7 layer 
OSI model, Open System Interconnection 
model. 
So there's a model out there that has 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 layers. 
And they all have names, and they all 
have purposes, and they all have 
definitions. 
this was not quite as po-, this was not 
very popular. 
And I doubt that it's many places. 
because the TCPI model is the one that 
kind of won. 
Um, [COUGH] and so that's the one that 
we're going to study. 
But that doesn't mean that, that has to 
be the only one. 
But it is the one that has become popular 
on the internet. 
So, once you break the problem down from 
a big problem into four small problems, 
you have to develop documents about how 
these layers work together. 
How various computers work together. 
How routers work. 
All these things and so early in the 
process of the development of the Arpanet 
they created an open process to build 
these specifications. 
Where they would vite, invite engineers 
from all kinds of companies and 
universities and who knows what any 
expertise to show up at a meeting. 
Several times a year. 
I mention the IETF meeting when I was 
talking about the history of the Internet 
and Tim Berners-Lee boff, that only 15 
people showed up to. 
That's this meeting, the Internet 
Engineering Task Force, which is just a 
bunch of engineers that get into rooms, 
many rooms, and solve a bunch of 
problems. 
And so the standards that come out of 
this, you can go read them, they're all 
open documents. 
They're very throwback documents. 
They've got this text thing that's dial 
this like, beautiful upper case, it 
reminds me of back when printers didn't 
have a lower case. 
and these are documents that describe how 
most components of the internet work 
together. 
So, the layered architecture that I just 
described where you have a computer and 
then it sends data out to back of it. 
And then hop, hop, hop, hop, hop through 
routers, and then the data arrives at the 
destination computer, And then it, the 
destination computer sends it back it 
hop, hop, hop, hop, hop coming back and 
it comes to you. 
We're going to expand on this a little 
bit. 
So each of these hosts on the two ends is 
going to expand to this much right here. 
So that's one host. 
That's another host. 
And each of these routers is going to 
expand into this. 
So this bottom picture is just an 
expanded version of this upper picture. 
So that we can see how the Internet 
layers work together. 
So when you send a message in on your 
computer, it's -- this is all software, 
application, transport, Internet link. 
So this is all software, and then it all 
comes out the little plug on the back of 
your computer. 
Right. 
[SOUND] So, maybe your computer has a 
little plug like this on the back of it. 
Right? 
That's an ethernet plug and here's an 
ethernet wire and I plug my local area 
network in. 
Right? 
And so, this right here is that right 
there. 
That's kind of the plug. 
It might be WiFi which means it's kind of 
like air but If you have a wire like 
this, then it's a little more tangible, 
and there's something on the other end of 
that wire. 
This is a very short wire, but there 
would be a router on the other end of 
that wire. 
[COUGH] The router takes the data off the 
wire and then forwards it just like a 
post office, intermediate post office 
would do, onto the next link. 
On to the next one. 
And this would be multiple hops in here, 
they're only showing 2 hops. 
And finally it's on the last link going 
to that computer at Stanford. 
And then it goes up through these 4 
layers of software and then goes and does 
whatever it's going to do. 
Now when they send you the response back 
it kind of goes the other way. 
And back up and back to you. 
So if this was you in a web browser, you 
know and then here's me. 
And here's a slide I've got, right. 
This web browser and you moving your 
cursor in the web browser is sending 
stuff back and forth to the [UNKNOWN] 
servers right here. 
And that's what's happening, alright. 
So If as you look at this picture over 
here, this left colmn is the host you're 
coming from. 
The right column is the host you're going 
to, and the riders are these things in 
the middle, okay? 
Okay. 
So let's start looking at all four 
layers. 
We are going to start at the bottom, at 
the link layer, then we're going to move 
up. 
So if you recall when I talked about the, 
the, the basic reason why we even have a 
layered architecture at all, is to 
simplify the problem. 
To simplify the problem. 
So the idea of the link layer. 
Is, the link layer is a, it, it on-, only 
worries about getting the data across one 
hump, right? 
Only worries about getting the data from, 
across one piece of wire. 
White like voltage goes on these little 
wires, and. 
How we send the stuff and if more than 
one computer's using the same wire, how 
do we share? 
It's a complex enough problem but, we 
don't worry about the whole world. 
We worry about this one link layer and so 
the link layer is sort of like the 
connection out of one computer and into 
another computer. 
And, and this might be fiber optic, might 
be, you know, 40 miles or it might be 40 
feet for all we know. 
But it's one link, okay? 
And then, a router pulls it off that link 
and then forwards it onto another link. 
If you go to the post office, you could 
think of the, the person who picks your 
mail up from your house, with the thing 
on their shoulder, that's one link And 
they put it in a truck which takes it to 
a place that puts it in a semi truck. 
And then it puts it to another place that 
puts it on a train. 
And the semi truck and the train and the 
postman or postwoman are these little 
link layers. 
Each person or semi truck is not taking 
it all the way, they're just getting a 
little farther. 
So that's the link layer So the link 
layer doesn't worry about the rest of 
this stuff. 
It really, the stuff that is defined on 
this wire, it doesn't even care if 
there's a world wide web or anything. 
Its job is to get data across one foot. 
That's what its job is. 
Is it up, is it down, how do we share? 
It doesn't care. 
It's got a very narrow view. 
So. 
What it means is we can zoom in on this 
problem, right. 
We can zoom in and focus and ignore 
everything else. 
So the link layer basically asks 
questions like, you know, I've got some 
data inside the computer and I want to 
send it out. 
How do I encapsulate it? 
What if this is shared? 
How do I deal with that? 
And common Link technologies that we see 
are like Ethernet or WiFi or cable modem, 
DSL, satellite or optical. 
These are all links layers of one form or 
another. 
So if you're going back to this Ethernet 
link layer, which is one of our favorites 
cause it's kind of ubiquitous. 
Other than wireless it is probably 
Ethernet is the most ubiquitous link 
layer. 
[SOUND] So, when the manufacturer builds 
an ethernet or a wireless adapter, they 
actually build into it, which is probably 
right here. 
No, it could be right here, they build 
into it a serial number. 
So, they, they mark this as having a 
serial number. 
And you can actually whether you're on 
Windows or Mac, you can work your way 
down to find the serial number for your 
actual manufacturer piece of equipment. 
So there's mine on the Mac. 
That's an example one on the Mac. 
And that's an example one on the PC. 
They tend to be six two digit numbers 
concatonated together often with colons 
or in this case with Windows it shows 
dashes. 
And so this is a raspberry pie and all 
the raspberry pies are going to actually 
have similar prefixes and then serial 
numbers within that prefix. 
And so the raspberry pies get 
manufactured, they come out of the 
manufacturing line with this sequence 
number just kind of going chug chug chug, 
up up up up up. 
And, then they get shipped to all corners 
of the world. 
And so, these numbers are not the numbers 
for this to get across the world, all the 
number, all these serial numbers at the 
link layer are good for are to get across 
one connection, in case that connection 
is shared. 
And if you were to plug this into a hub, 
and you're plugging other computers into 
that same hub. 
Well then you're sharing that connection. 
And this computer might see the traffic 
for that other computer. 
And so we use the physical addresses so 
that this computer knows which of the 
packets belong to it on the piece of 
wire. 
So, wired ethernet or wifi certainly if 
you're sitting in a room with a bunch of 
wifi computers. 
You're sharing the air. 
So let's come up with rules how to share 
this, how to share nicely and how to 
behave. 
So the way it works, ccc, is you 
could...the ethernet could easily have a 
bunch of computers hooked to it right. 
Cause its really shared, and so they're 
all sitting here, they're all talking 
simultaneously. 
No. 
But, we have a com, we have a pair of 
computers that want to talk. 
So, it's not just one. 
It's got a bunch of folks sitting here. 
[SOUND] Just draw a bunch of em. 
Bunches of folks. 
They're all talking or all potentially 
talking [SOUND] and we gotta figure out 
how in the shared medium. 
Like this is, think of this as a hub and 
they're all connected into this hub 
including the two we want to talk. 
They're all connected in the hub, 
including the two that we want to talk. 
And how can these two make sure that the 
data goes, is, is the data that's sent 
with the intention of going to this 
computer, this router. 
How can it make sure that it gets there? 
Well, if it knows the address of the 
sending and receiving unit It just 
encodes that, in the packet. 
And that way, it sort of goes by all 
these folks. 
Let me change colors here. 
The packet we send goes by all these 
folks, and even if they all heard every 
one of the packets, they all know that it 
doesn't belong to them because they all 
have a different number and this is the 
only one that responds to it. 
So that allows them to share the wireless 
or the wire, and, share the wireless to 
the wire and have it all work out for 
them. 
So, [COUGH] so that's the idea, the link 
layer. 
Now, again, remember this might only be 
fifty feet, or fifty yards, or fifty 
meters. 
And they can be meters. 
It's only 50 meters, but you still have 
to share the network in that 50 meters. 
And then your router takes it off of that 
and forwards it on a different link. 
And that's how we get across the country. 
But that's the next layer up, and let's 
not worry about that for now. 
So, the idea is think about one link, 
whether it's fiber optic or cable, or 
wireless, or wifi. 
And so what are the kind of problems that 
you have to solve on this link layer? 
Well, so one of the things that's cool 
about many link layers is, like wireless 
and ethernet, is they can be shared, and 
it makes it real easy just plug new 
computers in. 
So you just sort of like, here's a hub, 
and you just plug another computer in, 
and it's on the network. 
But they have to come up with a way to 
avoid the chaos when they're sharing. 
And so, the way Ethernet does this is 
with a technique called, Carrier Sense 
Media Access with Collision Detection. 
And as you'll see, a lot of things we do 
on the internet have a lot to do with 
courtesy. 
Meaning that we're just nice. 
And if everybody's nice, it all works 
out. 
kind of like driving in a car. 
Just everyone can't run through the stop 
sign at the same time. 
Some of you gotta stop, got a green 
light, your turn, my turn, whatever. 
This probably wouldn't work so well with 
cars, because sometimes you do have a 
collision of packets. 
You just have to wait. 
Packet collisions don't crush your car. 
They just slow your data down. 
So, here we go. 
This is basically carrier sense media 
access with collision detection. 
The first thing you do if you want to 
send some data, say we got some data 
inside our little computer and we want to 
send it out, knowing that there might be 
other data going by The first thing we do 
is listen. 
We listen to what's on there. 
If it's not silent we just wait until it 
goes silent and then we start sending. 
So if someone's already using it, why 
crash into their data and crush their 
data? 
Because there's, it's shared, there's 
only one. 
You can't both be sending at the same 
time. 
So first you listen. 
Once it's silent you begin transmitting 
data. 
[COUGH] And then what you do is you also 
listen to your own data and if your own 
data is coming back, then it's sounding 
pretty good. 
and And then if, if you. 
If there is a collision, because there's 
a chance that two computers will want to 
send at the same time and they'll 
collide. 
Then what they have to do is back off.. 
And they have a sophisticated random 
number calculation, so that they back off 
not always the same amount. 
Each computer backs off a different 
amount, and they make it so that it's 
fair. 
So that one computer's not always backing 
the most off. 
So it's very fair. 
So it's, when you detect a collision, you 
retransmit after a random backup. 
First, you avoid collisions. 
But in the, in the rare case that you 
have a collision, then you do this. 
And so, 
[NOISE] I want to introduce you to the 
person who invented Ethernet, Ethernet. 
Hmm, This is Robert Melcalf and he was 
working at Xerox, Palo Alto research 
center, PARC, everyone calls it PARC. 
And they had, they were building what is 
most considered the first computer, the 
Alto computers. 
They were connecting line printers, or, 
fast printers to these. 
Pate, Xerox was building the first, laser 
printers. 
And they needed something faster. 
And so they just started building, and 
they built this thing called Ethernet. 
Now it's a little different than the 
Ethernet that we see, the first Ethernet 
that they built is a little different, 
you can see a picture of it down here. 
If you ever go to Xerox Park and get in, 
you'll go see this little museum they 
have. 
it used a single piece of cable that ran 
along, they just ran it down the hallway, 
and they would connect a tap in And then 
they would use that to send the data. 
So it would go down the hallway and a tap 
come out at each office, and they were 
truly sharing the media. 
This comment is not shared, except when 
you plug it into a hub. 
That's what makes the shared. 
it was inspired by an earlier wireless 
network where they were doing not 
collision detection, but retransmission 
called Aloha, and a lot of early network, 
packet network inspiration comes from the 
Alohanet in Uni-, comes from University 
of Hawaii. 
And because they didn't have anything 
except wireless, but they did have 
wireless, they did a lot of really cool 
early research on wireless. 
And so let's go ahead and meet Bob 
Metcalfe the inventor, one of the 
inventors of ethernet.
